    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2026-02-24</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>Use the XR App in a lawful, respectful way. Do not attempt to break, abuse, overload, or interfere with the site or other users.</p>

    <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for activity on your account.</p>

    <h2>3. User content</h2>
    <p>You keep ownership of data you create, including game and character data. You grant us permission to store and process that data to operate the service.</p>

    <h2>4. Availability</h2>
    <p>The site is provided "as is". We may change or remove features at any time, and we cannot guarantee uninterrupted availability.</p>

    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access for abusive behavior, security reasons, or violations of these terms.</p>

    <h2>6. Liability</h2>
    <p>To the extent allowed by law, Xeon Rapture is not liable for indirect or consequential damages resulting from your use of the service.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms. Continued use after updates means you accept the revised terms.</p>

    <p>Questions can be sent through the project's feedback form on the home page.</p>
