# General Rules

Sometimes you'll need to track your relationship with a person or reputation with an organization or in a society! Here are the rules that help you keep track of that.

Reputation and relationships usually go from -5 to +5, where -5 means they want to ruin you or ruin you and +5 means they're very loyal and would do most anything for you.

Below is a chart explaining what each level means; when I say OSP I'm talking about whatever Organization, Society, or Person you want to track your relationship with.

| Reputation/<br>Relationship<br>Level | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| +7                                   | The OSP is dedicated to you mind, body, and soul. They would give literally anything for you and your success.                                                                                   |
| +6                                   | The OSP is extremely invested in your success and love you almost more than words. A lot of their time is dedicated to you.                                                                      |
| 0---------                           | -------------------------------------------------------------------0                                                                                                                             |
| +5                                   | The OSP will sacrifice a lot to help you out! They love you; the meaning of love will change depending on who the OSP is. They trust you implicitly and will believe basically anything you say. |
| +4                                   | The OSP is really, really into you and will support you quite a bit, but they're only willing to sacrifice so much for you. They trust you *deeply*.                                             |
| +3                                   | The OSP likes you a lot! They'll want to work with you and will actively seek out your help but you're not a permanent fixture in their mind quite yet.                                          |
| +2                                   | The OSP likes you quite a bit but they don't have any strong feelings for you yet. They're starting to trust you!                                                                                |
| +1                                   | The OSP kinda likes you but doesn't feel strongly about it: they're open either way.                                                                                                             |
| 0                                    | The OSP is neutral towards you: no positive feelings, but no negative ones either.                                                                                                               |
| -1                                   | The OSP doesn't like you much but their opinion is fairly open to being swayed one way or another.                                                                                               |
| -2                                   | The OSP's opinion has soured even more, but their distaste for you isn't intense, they just don't like you. They don't trust you much.                                                           |
| -3                                   | The OSP has solidified their opinion of you: you suck. They won't want to work with you and talk bad about you but will probably not actively harm you even if given a chance.                   |
| -4                                   | The OSP doesn't like you at all but isn't actively trying to harm you; if given a chance, though, they will probably harm you or sabotage you. They don't trust you *at all*.                    |
| -5                                   | The OSP hates your guts and wants to ruin you or outright kill you. They are active in trying to accomplish this goal. They distrust you vehemently and won't believe anything you say.          |
| 0---------                           | -------------------------------------------------------------------0                                                                                                                             |
| -6                                   | The OSP really, *really* hates you, so much so that it has become a part of their personality. A lot of their time is dedicated to ruining you.                                                  |
| -7                                   | This OSP's entire personality is dedicated to destroying you mind, body, and soul. This is all they do, all they think about. They would destroy themselves to spite you.                        |

# Playing With Reputation/Relationship Level

## Gaining R/R Level

So how do you gain R/R Level with an OSP? Well, help them out! Find out what they want and help them get it! Keep them safe, understand their needs and listen to them, give them things. There are many ways to increase your R/R Level with an OSP, and it'll all depend on who you're trying to get into good graces with.

For example, if you want to get tight with a romantic interest, listen to them, take them out on dates, and nurture them in ways that resonate with them! 

If you're looking for more trust or better jobs from an organization like a corp or a government, show that you can keep their secrets and will do the jobs they give you well. Show resourcefulness and solve problems they didn't know they had.

If you do something really great it's possible to gain more than one level of R/R with one action!

## Losing R/R Level

There are as many ways to lose Reputation or Relationship Level as there are to gain it, and once again it depends on who you're dealing with. Here's a list of some options:
- Slight them
- Ignore them
- Fight with them
- Sabotage them
- Undermine them
- Attack them

In short, if you want to lose R/R Level with an OSP, learn what they want and make it so they can't get it, or take what they already have from them! But keep in mind that once you're far down the scale it takes a lot of time and effort to repair the relationship or reputation that you've lost.

Once again, if you do something really awful it's possible to lose more than one level of R/R with one action!

## Tracking

The GM can either have the players track their relationship level or reputation level themselves and/or track them on their own without telling the players. It's often a smart idea to do a mix of both! Sometimes you will know where you stand in society but you won't know where you stand with a specific person.

> [!NOTE]
> ### To GMs
> Sometimes it can be useful to track the relationship of the whole adventuring group with a certain organization *as well as* the relationship of one particular character with an NPC that's within that same organization. 
> 
> This whole process can get messy so feel free to either chart or graph out the whole relationship/reputation web or, alternatively, don't worry about any particular relationship if it seems like it won't be an important one in the future. Some games don't call for using this mechanic at all! Do whatever works for your GMing style and your party.

## Obscuring R/R Level

A specific person or organization may not want to show exactly how much they like or dislike you for a number of reasons! They may act like they're all good with you but are secretly working against you, or maybe they're standoffish but secretly admire you and are just afraid of the consequences.

In these cases it'd be smart for the GM to let the players guess what their reputation level might be with the OSP but never tell them outright.

## The Extremes

Usually -5 and +5 are impossible to move beyond and are only accessible in extreme situations or when everything lines up perfectly. 

To move towards the positive extremes one must do something large or sacrifice something big in order to endear yourself to the OSP, and to move towards the negative extremes one must either ruin the OSP's life or they must believe that you've ruined their life.

There are multiple ways to play the 6s and 7s, though the negatives are more simple than the positives. Parties in the -6, -7 range simply hate you and will do anything to destroy you and so are, by definition, in an extremely unhealthy place emotionally, but parties in the +6, +7 range can be either healthy or unhealthy depending on the character and the situation.

You could either play the positive extreme as a super healthy thing, where the OSP has appropriate boundaries and just love you so deeply and committedly that they're willing to do anything for you, or as a super unhealthy thing, where the OSP is obsessed in a creepy and inappropriate way.

The extremes are almost impossible to approach if the OSP is an organization or a society, and if they are then it's almost always because one person or a couple people are driving everyone toward those extremes.

## Big Swings

Most parties are fairly levelheaded and will need some convincing to swing them up or down the R/R chart. Some, however, are more suggestible or vulnerable and are either willing to love you or hate you if you give them the slightest chance!

For example, small children (unless they've been conditioned otherwise) are usually very forgiving and quick to love and trust. You can give a kid a candy and they'll trust you! This might shoot them from a +1 to a +4 with just one action.

On the other hand, there may be a large organization, such as a nation or a corp, that takes any provocation as a threat. These parties see otherwise neutral parties with a permanent -1, and the moment you speak out against them you'll shoot down to a -4 or -5, at which point they'll jail you or kill you for even daring to stand up to them.

People or organizations that already know a little bit about you from second-hand or third-hand information are often primed to swing a certain way but are just waiting to see you act for themselves. In this circumstance feel free to set them to a -1 or +1 depending on what they've heard and then if what you do confirms their suspicions they'll take a big jump up or down.

Occasionally you'll run into parties that are equally as likely to swing either way: this would be very suggestible people or even certain societies, who will hate you the moment you do anything wrong but forget about it as soon as you do something right.

# Types of Parties

This chart is pretty self-explanatory when it comes to a 1-on-1 relationship: this person has feelings towards you, whether they're negative or positive.

Relationship or Reputation Level can be a bit more obtuse when coming from an organization or a society, however. So what does it mean to have a positive or negative relationship or reputation with an organization or society?

## Organizations

The more negative your relationship is with an organization the less willing they are to work with you, and if it gets negative enough then they see you as a threat that needs to be eliminated. If your relationship is positive then it means that they're willing to work with you, and the more positive your reputation is with them the more willing they are to stick their collective neck out to help you.

Some organizations won't go past a certain level of negativity or positivity with you! For example you may work with a gang, doing jobs and getting to know your handlers, but you'll never reach a high level within the gang because they'll never be willing to sacrifice for you (unless you're willing to do some heinous initiation ritual to get inducted into the gang officially, but even that will come with caveats).

## Societies

Your reputation in a society changes depending on what people hear about you and will determine how the society as a whole treats you. This could change based on things you do and can be completely justified, or it could be based on bad PR, racism, or any sort of unjustified reason!

Having a negative reputation in society means people who have heard about you are primed to dislike you and, at worst, will be quickly hostile towards you. Having a positive reputation means that random people that you don't know will be willing to help you even at expense to themselves.

Sometimes the way a society sees strangers in general will be positive or negative! For example, a society that has had a lot of insurgency from outside would be more suspicious of you and would see you at a -1 or -2 right off the bat, or a society with a healthy tradition of hospitality might greet you with a +1 or +2.
