# Intro

Drugs! Love 'em or hate 'em, there's no doubt that they exist.

Here's a quick rule overview! See below for more details:

![[Drug Rules Drawing.png]]

Here's the rundown:
1. Drugs give buffs and benefits when you take them and then debuffs after the high wears off
2. Taking the drug again when the debuff kicks in staves off the debuff, but it'll return after the high wears off
	1. For Soft Drugs, the debuff is worse depending on how many times you've tried to stave it off
3. Each time you take a drug you gain a stack of Addiction. Gain enough Addiction stacks to hit the Dependency Threshold and you become [[Drug Rules#Dependency and Addiction|Dependent]]
	1. Dependency Threshold is 10 for Soft Drugs and varies for Hard Drugs
	2. You lose two stacks of Addiction every week (at the top of the week) for each drug that you have a stack for
4. Being Dependent on a drug gets worse the longer you stay Dependent
5. If you ever want to get off of a drug then you'll start experiencing [[Drug Rules#Withdrawal Symptoms|Withdrawal Symptoms]]. It takes a couple days for the symptoms to go away and a full month to completely wipe out your Addiction stacks.
6. If you ever want to mix Hard Drugs together or mix Hard Drugs and Soft Drugs then roll on the [[Drug Rules#Mixing Drugs|Mixing Drugs]] table at the bottom



# Soft Drugs

Soft drugs will give you a stat bonus for an hour when you take them and then a similarly-scaled stat debuff for an hour afterwards. To extend the high and the stat bonus you can take the drug again, in which case the debuff will be worse.

The **standard versions** of these drugs have buffs and debuffs that last for an hour each, but there are **stronger versions** whose buffs and debuffs both last for 6 hours each. Also, the stronger versions count as taking the drug twice so it moves you down the debuff table faster.

Standard versions give you 1 Addiction stack and move you 1 level down the Soft Drug Debuff table, and Strong versions give you 2 Addiction stacks and move you 2 levels down when you come off the high.

The buffs don't stack! If you take another dose before the previous one has worn off, all it does is give you stacks of Addiction and resets the time it will take before the debuff happens.

Soft Drugs have an Dependency Threshold of 10 (see Dependency and Addiction rules below).

Most Soft Drugs cost about 2 credits per dose, with the strong versions costing 5 per dose.

Here are the substances and their buffs, debuffs, and standard and strong versions.

# Hard Drugs

So you wanna take hard drugs, huh? Get away from the monotony of life, or maybe escape some trauma? I can't say I blame ya, buddy.

Hard drugs have a variety of effects, and often their debuffs after the effects wear off are much, much worse.

You gain a stack of Addiction each time you take the drug. If your Addiction stacks ever hit the Dependency Threshold then see the Dependency and Addiction rules below for effects.

Make sure to check the Mixing Drugs section at the very bottom if you feel like mixing Hard Drugs together or Hard Drugs with Soft Drugs.

Most Hard Drugs cost a minimum of 10 credits per dose.

# Dependency and Addiction

If you ever hit the Dependency Threshold for a certain drug then you are addicted to that drug.

You lose two stacks of Addiction each week (at the top of the week) for each drug that you have a stack for.

The longer you stay Dependent the worse things get. Soft drug debuffs cap out at 5 weeks, but hard drugs go all the way down.

Taking the substance while Dependent still gives all the same benefits and staves off your withdrawal symptoms for 6 hours, but after 6 hours you start suffering. See the Withdrawal Symptoms table below.

## Weeks Dependent Debuffs

| -------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        1 | You feel DISGUSTING. Lose half your current health.                                                                                                                     |
|        2 | You feel awful! Like barfing your guts out! And your head feels like it's going to explode! Your next check is done with triple disadvantage.                           |
|        3 | You start feeling really **aggressive**. Take out your aggression! You don't have to fight or even take it out on a person, but you just _have_ to take it out somehow. |
|        4 | You get reaaaaally sleepy. Like, so sleepy. A nap would be nice, wouldn't it?                                                                                           |
|        5 | Absolutely nothing happens! You honestly didn't expect this.                                                                                                            |
|        6 | You come to a realization. It could be a "weed thought" or a real introspective breakthrough. Drugs must be good for you, cuz this feels really nice!                   |
|        7 | You get a huge burst of energy and either want to talk a lot, eat a lot, or run a lot.                                                                                  |
|        8 | You start hallucinating! It's weird, and maybe a little disturbing, or maybe it's nice, who knows.                                                                      |
|        9 | You feel great! Somehow that mix of drugs is even better than just one drug alone. Your next check is done with triple advantage.                                       |
|       10 | You feel AMAZING. Heal half your health.                                                                                                                                |
