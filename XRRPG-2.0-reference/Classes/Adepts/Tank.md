# Intro

Adepts channel the xeon through their own bodies to gain powers and enact potent effects.

You must have the same chroma as the class you pick! Tanks must have blue chromas.

This is how you level up any of the classes below:

| Class Level | Class Abilities                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

| 1           | Basic Power Tier 1 &<br>Advanced Power Tier 1              |
| 2           | Basic Power Tier 2 &<br>Advanced Power Tier 2              |
| 3           | Basic Power Tier 3 &<br>Advanced Power Tier 3              |
| 4+          | For each additional level take a Tier in an Advanced Power |
