# Intro

Stat: Vigor or Endurance

Elementalists find little xenic elemental spirits and make relationships with them! Over time Elementalists are able to team up with their elementals to cast techniques that manipulate the elements around them.

Elementalists always have access to their full list of techniques at their Level, and each technique signifies an ability that they've figured out how to do in conjunction with their elemental spirit friends.

They can manipulate the elements at range, unlike Demititans which can  only shift and morph elements that are at hand.

Elementalists *have* to have the element that they're manipulating already around them in order to influence it, and a technique can't be cast if there isn't enough of that element around to cast it!

Sometimes an element will not be manipulatable, such as if it's been protected or shielded by xenic means, or if it's a strong magic or tech item. If the material or object you're trying to morph is under a large amount of strain (such as the foundations of a building or the support struts of a spaceship) then it will take more time to manipulate.

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to dealing with spirits and other spirit checks, so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to dealing with spirits and other spirit checks. Using MD this way does not expend stamina.

Get creative with your abilities! The techniques below are written to have solid bounds, but as an Elementalist you can manipulate the elements at your disposal any way you wish (as long as it fits the Requirements for a technique you have access to below). 

If you want to manipulate more substance than is listed in the Requirements column, it might just take more than one Action to be able to do whatever you're thinking of.
