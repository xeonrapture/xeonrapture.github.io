# Intro

Stat: Any

Summoners are similar to mystics in that they find spirits and make relationships with them. They're different, however, in that they've learned how to make their spirits physical so they can interact with the world in exchange for the spirits being vulnerable to damage.

You can corporealize all of your spirits at the top of the day (after a Deep Rest), but it requires a 30-minute ritual to corporealize them. 

You may do this ritual later on in the day if you'd like. Once a spirit's health has been depleted they turn ethereal and can't interact with anything, and they can only be corporealized until after the next Deep Rest.

You can't make your spirits go ethereal once they're made corporeal! Though most spirits can be resized so that they're easier to keep near you once they've been granted physicality.

Doing anything so hard or risky with your spirits that it needs an Action Roll costs a Stamina.

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to dealing with spirits and other spirit checks, so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to dealing with spirits and other spirit checks. Using an MD this way does not spend stamina.

| Class <br>Level | Spirit <br>Range | Class Abilities | Total Spells |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 1               | 25 ft            | Gain 2 Spirits  | ≈            |
| 2               | 50 ft            | Gain 1 Spirit   | ≈            |
| 3               | 100 ft           | Gain 1 Spirit   | ≈            |

# Basic Spells

Below is a list of spells you have access to at all times, even if all your spirits have been taken out for the day.

| Spell            | Tier | Effect                                                                           |

| Resurrect Spirit | III  | Bring a spirit that's been downed back up to half HP.                            |

# Spirits

Below is a table including the vibes of the four types of spirits you can gain as your allies. These spirits, their aesthetics, and the way their abilities and powers look can be shaped to look any way you'd like! As long as the mechanics don't change.

Each spirit has a stat that they use for their own abilities. This stat is equal to the stat you use for Summoner abilities, which can be anything but needs to be decided upon when you gain your first level in Summoner.

| Spirit              | Spirit <br>Stat | Focus                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hovering Spirit     | Wit             | Ranged attacks, repositioning allies, and other tactical utility        |
| Strong Spirit       | Endurance       | Tanking damage, protecting allies, pushing around enemies               |
| Healing Spirit      | Intuition       | Healing and protecting spirits, buffing allies, distraction             |
| Glass Cannon Spirit | Vigor           | Dealing massive amounts of damage before they get taken down themselves |

Some abilities level up as you grow in power with the following format: Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3.
