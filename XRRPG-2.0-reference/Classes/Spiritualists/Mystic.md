# Intro

Stat: Any

Mystics find spirits—whether they be the spirits of deceased mortals or creatures, xenic sprites, or demons—and develop relationships with them. These spirits may be spirits that you've made a mutual pact with, or spirits that you just have good relationships with and have decided to work together.

Think about why you're working with these spirits! What kinds of deals have you made with them? Selfish spirits will make selfish deals, good spirits will be more selfless, and most spirits will want something out of your relationship even if it's just community and companionship.

You might've even forcibly bound some spirits to work with you (most common with dark spirits). In that case, how do you relate to them? Do they hate you? Do you hate them?

# Basics

Feel free to customize the visual flair of your spirits! They can look like regular ghosts, or animals, or strange alien beings, or red horny devils, or anything in between. And think about their backstories: how did they end up with you, and what memories do they have, if any?

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to dealing with spirits and other spirit checks, so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to dealing with spirits and other spirit checks. Using MD this way does not expend stamina.

You may open your eyes into the xenic plane so that you can see spirits as many times equal to your Mystic Level per day (this effects lasts 10 minutes).

You don't have to see your spirits to control them, as long as they are within range. Any device or ability that detects xeon may be used to find you by following your connection with your spirits.

You may upgrade beyond lvl 3 if you want all the spirits!

Spirits must upgrade from tier I to II to III.

# Spirits

Each spirit can learn a certain amount of spells that they can use. Any spirit can only be doing one thing at a time (besides spirit scry, which can be done at the same time as any other spell), and any spell that is labeled "Latch" in the tables below is one that puts the spirit out of commission for the duration of the spell. 

Spirit move speed is instantaneous but must be within your range (unless stated otherwise). Spirits enact their effects by inhabiting the space of the target or the effect or being right next to them (e.g. the spirits don't cast their effects at range).

Most spirits attack for 2 dmg on a Success. Anything consequential, difficult, or risky that you have your spirit do costs your own Stamina as you direct them and they borrow your vitality for their power. Usually Mystic Trickery and Spirit Scry doesn't cost Stamina.

You may command a spirit to stop an action that they're doing whenever you'd like. You control whether your spirits are visible or invisible, unless stated otherwise.

You may target any living being when it's stated that you attach to or affect an ally or enemy, including yourself. Multiple spirits may inhabit the same target, including yourself.

Any ability that seals away or banishes a spirit may be used to end any mystic spirit attaching ability, including ones that affect you or your allies. The person sealing or banishing the spirit does an Action to determine whether the sealing or banishing is Successful.

Feel free to experiment a bit and ask the GM if any given spirit can do something beyond the scope of their abilities! If it fits the general vibe of the spirit then they can do it.
