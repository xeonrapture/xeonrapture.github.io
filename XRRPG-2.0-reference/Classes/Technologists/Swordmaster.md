# Intro

Stat: Any

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to use all technology (non-combat applications only), so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to all non-combat technology checks. These MD do not expend stamina.

You may have separate swords for these effects, or you may pack all the abilities you get from this class into one sword! Just keep in mind that you might lose the sword and have to make it again.

You are able to create any of the gadgets you use in this class as long as you can find scrap to make them. Otherwise you might have to buy parts, which will cost 30 Valdan credits per sword made or power added to an existing sword.

The powers are tied to the sword that you make, but your attack damage is something you can do with whatever sword you yield (including the Powerful Attack).

You can only do up to 3 Powerful Attacks per day. If you miss on a Powerful Attack roll you may save it and use it later.
