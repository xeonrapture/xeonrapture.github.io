# Intro

Stat: Wit or Int

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to use all technology (non-combat applications only), so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to all non-combat technology checks. These MD do not expend stamina.

You are able to create any of the gadgets you use in this class as long as you can find scrap to make them. Otherwise you might have to buy parts, which will cost 30 Valdan credits per gadget (deduct the original price if you're modifying an existing gadget).

Some gadgets are upgraded versions of lower-level gadgets, and with those devices they can perform the abilities of their lower-level counterparts.

| 1           | I               | You can make all the Tier I guns. Each gun can have 1 effect.                                      |
| 2           | II              | You can make all the Tier II guns.<br>Each gun can have up to 2 effects.                           |
| 3           | III             | You can make all the Tier III guns.<br>You can have up to 3 Large guns on your person at one time. |

You can create your own guns! Guns do half damage if the target is out of their range. Rifle, musket, and sniper projectiles speed up after they leave the barrel, giving them both a minimum and a maximum range.

As you level up each gun can contain multiple effects, which you can switch between at will.
