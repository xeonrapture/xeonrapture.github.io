# Intro

Stat: Wit, Intuition

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to use all technology (non-combat applications only), so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to all non-combat technology checks. These MD do not expend stamina.

You are able to create any of the gadgets you use in this class as long as you can find scrap to make them. Otherwise you might have to buy parts, which will cost 30 Valdan credits per gadget (deduct the original price if you're modifying an existing gadget).

Some gadgets are upgraded versions of lower-level gadgets, and with those devices they can perform the abilities of their lower-level counterparts.

You can now build drones! At the start you can have up to 2 drones active at any one time, and they will usually float behind you. As you level up, you will gain the ability to add different abilities to your drones.

Drones can float as little as a couple of inches off the ground. The max height of a drone goes up as your level does.

Drone Connection Range means how far the drone can be from you and still stay connected. Drones that shoot have a beam range of 30 ft.

Your drones can be destroyed if you get unlucky or mess up, but they become harder to hit and more heavily armored as you level up.

You can have up to 1 drone docked on a backpack at any one time.

| Healing             | I    | Can heal up to 2 HP's worth of Injuries up to 5 times a day (one target).

| Advanced Hacking    | III  | You can now attempt to hack cybermods, weaponry, and most other technological objects. If successful all the enemy's cybermods go down for a turn, or the select tech or weaponry goes down. This ability can only be used on any individual person or object once per day.                                                                                          |
