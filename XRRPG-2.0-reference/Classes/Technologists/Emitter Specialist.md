# Intro

Stat: Wit, Intuition

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to use all technology (non-combat applications only), so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to all non-combat technology checks. These MD do not expend stamina.

You are able to create any of the gadgets you use in this class as long as you can find scrap to make them. Otherwise you might have to buy parts, which will cost 30 Valdan credits per gadget (deduct the original price if you're modifying an existing gadget).

Some gadgets are upgraded versions of lower-level gadgets, and with those devices they can perform the abilities of their lower-level counterparts.

You can now make emitters, which are small devices that you can throw which will stick to floors, walls, or ceilings. These devices emit shields and other effects, and can also be activated and kept on your person.

These devices remain tethered to you with an invisible xenic tether, and when the device is spent or when you're done with it you can make it come back to you.

You emitters can be destroyed if you get unlucky or mess up, but as you level up you find better ways to armor them so they're harder to destroy.

You can either throw these by hand or launch them from a gun that you make!
