# Intro

Stat: Vigor, Endurance

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to use all technology (non-combat applications only), so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to all non-combat technology checks. These MD do not expend stamina.

You are able to create any of the gadgets you use in this class as long as you can find scrap to make them. Otherwise you might have to buy parts, which will cost 30 Valdan credits per gadget (deduct the original price if you're modifying an existing gadget).

Some gadgets are upgraded versions of lower-level gadgets, and with those devices they can perform the abilities of their lower-level counterparts.

Brawlers can make gauntlets, armor, and boots that they use to deal damage, move quickly, defend themselves, and achieve other effects. Unlike other Techie classes, Brawlers create one full set of equipment that can achieve several effects, and have to remake the suit entirely to change what they can achieve.

The suit doesn't have to cover you entirely but should have a hand element, a foot element, and some armor element. Whether you have a helmet is an entirely aesthetic choice.

At level 1 you choose two effects total, and as you level up you can put more and more effects into your suit at one time. You only know how to install a certain amount of effects, and you must take 30 min and have your tools available in order to switch effects.

Some abilities level up as you grow in power (Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3).

| Class Level | Total Effects Installed | Total Effects Known |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1           | 4                       | 6                   |
| 2           | 6                       | 8                   |
| 3           | 8                       | All                 |
