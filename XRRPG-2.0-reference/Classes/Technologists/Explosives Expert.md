# Intro

Stat: Any

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to use all technology (non-combat applications only), so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to all non-combat technology checks. These MD do not expend stamina.

Some gadgets are upgraded versions of lower-level gadgets, and with those devices they can perform the abilities of their lower-level counterparts.

You can now make explosives!

You can either throw these by hand or launch them from a cannon that you make!

- By Hand: 20 ft range
- Cannon: see details below

These explosives take time to make, so you only get so many of them per day. Feel free to save them up though, if you have room for them.

Basic Damage and Basic Heal bombs don't take space, and you get an unlimited amount of them per day!

Bomb effects don't flow around corners unless stated otherwise.
