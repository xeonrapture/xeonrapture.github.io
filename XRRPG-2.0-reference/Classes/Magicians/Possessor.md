# Intro

Possessors are very similar to physics but without a lot of the spells that inflict a condition. They get their power from harnessing the spirits of the mortal dead, and as such their magic is taboo and often corrupts the user. It's also more powerful than standard physic magic, and possessors have access to some spookier spells.

Really the only way to be a possessor without becoming evil is to develop relationships with the spirits you've chosen to control, or even better, make relationships with the spirits first and then make pacts with them so that they get something out of the deal.

Max Concentration means how many spells you can have up at the same time and still cast other spells, and Max Concentration Time is how long any given Concentration spell can be up. Concentration spells are ones that can be kept up for a period of time but there are several things that will probably break your Concentration:
- A Failure on a Medium Risk Action
- A Mixed Success or worse on a High Risk Action
- Taking a Severe Injury or worse

Getting a Success on an Extreme Risk Action or doing a Suicidal Risk Action at all might even break your Concentration, so try to avoid risky Actions entirely if you want to keep you Concentration up.

**Possessors can't use the same spell more than once in a row! Otherwise they tire out their thrall spirits.**

Servants (undead and constructs) have more health the more skilled and higher level their master is. Undead do +1 damage and constructs have +2 HP.

When a Possessor attacks or does something through their Servants they do the Action Roll and if they fail often the Servant takes the damage instead of them. If a Possessor has multiple Servants doing different things in combat then they'll do an Action Roll for each separate Action they are doing.

Servants don't contribute to Group Actions (a Possessor can't do Group Actions with only themselves and their Servants).

For each given Action you can combine multiple spells together if it makes sense to do them together (though this doesn't add their damage together). An Action including multiple spells only costs 1 Stamina! 

Any time you level up you can replace 2 of your known spells with a new one.
