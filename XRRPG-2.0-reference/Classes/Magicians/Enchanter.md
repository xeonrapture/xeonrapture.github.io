# Intro

Stat: Vig or Int

Enchanters are similar to physics but they use all sorts of gemstones and other substances to enact wilder and more magical effects. They have to have a bit of the substance to cast their effects, so they often have baubles on their bodies, long chains of charms, or little bags of gems.

You always have access to all the spells at the tier that are available to you.

For each given Action you can combine multiple spells together if it makes sense to do them together (though this doesn't add their damage together). An Action including multiple spells only costs 1 Stamina! 

You get Character Level divided by 3 (min of 1) worth of Mastery Dice to dealing with spirits (non-combat applications only), so if you're Character Level 6 then you get a +2d MD to all non-combat spirit checks. These MD do not expend stamina.

| 3           | III            | 3                 | 1 hr                   | Your Chaos Table opens up to both Major and Minor<br>Controlled Chaos: Can roll on the Chaos Table twice and pick the one you want for 0 stamina (3/day, replaces lvl 2 Chaos ability)       |

Max Concentration means how many spells you can have up at the same time and still cast other spells, and Max Concentration Time is how long any given Concentration spell can be up. Concentration spells are ones that can be kept up for a period of time but there are several things that will probably break your Concentration:
- A Failure on a Medium Risk Action
- A Mixed Success or worse on a High Risk Action
- Taking a Severe Injury or worse

Getting a Success on an Extreme Risk Action or doing a Suicidal Risk Action at all might even break your Concentration, so try to avoid risky Actions entirely if you want to keep you Concentration up.

# Spell List

Most of these spells just need a specific charm or substance to effect a certain effect, in which case what is needed will be listed in the substance column.

# Chaos Table

To enact these effects you use the shard of Kairidium that you found when you became an Enchanter, a rainbow, shimmery material that looks black and opaque in the dark and clear as glass in the light. When you use it it enacts a random xenic effect.

These effects don't cost any stamina but you still usually have to Succeed on an Action Roll to enact them (especially when you're using them on an enemy).

At Level 2 you can roll a d10 on the Chaos Table up to 3 times a day.

At Level 3 you must now roll a d20 on the Chaos Table.
