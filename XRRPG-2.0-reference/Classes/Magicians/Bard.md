# Intro

Bards are the fun cousins of the Physics: they manipulate the xeon with words like physics do, but they add song and sometimes dance or visuals to manipulate people's minds. This magic was developed by the kaldi and has been used to motivate groups of people, pump up parties, extract information, and terrify enemies.

Bards sing and an illusion is created in the mind of their target! The bard can manipulate this illusion to achieve a certain effect. These illusions can merge seamlessly with the real world or, if the bard is powerful enough, completely overwhelm every sense.

Pick an instrument or artform! This is what you're good at as a bard and is how you cast your spells! As you level up in bard you get better and better at your chosen artform.

All bards can passively change the emotions of the room when they play music, tell stories, dance, or whatever their art of choice is! The listeners can reject the emotions at will if they desire, as the bard is not forcing these emotions, merely suggesting them. This does not cost stamina.

Max Concentration means how many spells you can have up at the same time and still cast other spells, and Max Concentration Time is how long any given Concentration spell can be up. Concentration spells are ones that can be kept up for a period of time but there are several things that will probably break your Concentration:
- A Failure on a Medium Risk Action
- A Mixed Success or worse on a High Risk Action
- Taking a Severe Injury or worse

Getting a Success on an Extreme Risk Action or doing a Suicidal Risk Action at all might even break your Concentration, so try to avoid risky Actions entirely if you want to keep you Concentration up.

To start, take 6 Tier I spells from the list below.

# Spell List

You must be in range to keep concentration on any of these spells; the moment that the target moves out of your range is the moment the spell fails.

All bard effects are psychic and bypass xenic and physical defenses! But the vast majority of psychic abilities require you to overcome an enemy's mental defenses.

Any time you level up you can replace 2 of your known spells with a new one.

For any of these effects, if some other mechanic makes more sense in context then the GM may decide to use that instead of the mechanic that's listed in the Spell Effect details.

| Delusion             | X       | r       | Attempt to overcome an enemy's mental defenses. If the enemy fails, they suffer one of the following effects:<br>- They are shown an illusion that only they can see and that can encapsulate their entire world, including all of their senses. You can create a new world for them, take them back to their childhood, or anything you want. They lose track of where they are and what they are doing.<br>- You place an idea into their head that they believe for the duration of the spell. It can't be anything that significantly changes their beliefs but it may change how they think about the world around them, their allies, or themselves.<br>This effect takes one stamina per round to keep up. The enemy may keep trying to break out of this effect, but if you do a good job with the delusion they may never want to leave. |
