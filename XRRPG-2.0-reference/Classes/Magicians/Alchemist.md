# Intro

Stat: Wit or End

Alchemists are masters of both mundane and xenic chemistry, having an intimate knowledge of the magic inherent in materials of all kinds. They stay up late into the night, mixing and experimenting, and use the recipes they discover to affect the world around them. Many of them are odd, and some are even deranged, but none can say that they aren't capable of strange and intense feats of magic.

Alchemists must have their alchemist kit to make potions each morning! Their alchemist kit includes all basic components they need to make their potions, which include gems that they grind into powders and other materials (can be majority herbal, or mostly gems and stones, or whatever works best for your character's aesthetic).

Alchemist can also be reskinned as a **chef** who makes magical dishes every day and throws pies or other foods that explode for AOEs; or as a **herbal alchemist** who uses specific herbs, candles, symbolic objects, monster parts, and/or gems to cast spells. These reskins don't change any of the mechanics, for example no matter what aesthetic you pick you must spend time to create potions (or whatever your equivalent of potions might be).

# Potions

Every morning you can spend some time making potions. It takes 30 min total to mix all your potions (because the lower level potions get easier as you get better), and any potions left over from the previous day lose their effect (when you finish your Deep Rest). 

Somehow you always have spare flasks to make your potions in. Your potions can be very concentrated or distilled but for someone to get a buff from the potion they must ingest the entire potion. 

The debuffs are doubled if you get the target to ingest the potion, otherwise the potion can be thrown an splash on the target. All potions are single-target unless an AOE range is listed.

You brew 3 potions of Strength I and 2 potion of Strength II of each type that you have access to per day.

It requires a Stamina to throw or administer one of your potions, as they must be handled very carefully and often require certain steps to prep before throwing or administering (such as mixing a powder into the potion, dropping fire into the potion, setting a timer for a detonation device, etc.).

# Potion Mixing

You may mix any two potions together to create another effect! 

The I or II next to the name of the potion denotes the potion's Strength, and if there is at least one Strength II potion in the mix then the entire Mixed Potion is of Strength II.

Potions can be mixed on the fly, as regular potions generally have some space left in the bottle.
