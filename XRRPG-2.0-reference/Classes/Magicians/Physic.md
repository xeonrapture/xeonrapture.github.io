# Intro

Physics have learned the xenic language and as a result can tell the xeon what to do!

Physics have focuses that they cast their magic through. It can be pretty much anything though, from a wand to a staff to an orb.

Any time you level up you can replace 2 of your known spells with a new one.

For each given Action you can combine multiple spells together if it makes sense to do them together (though this doesn't add their damage together). An Action including multiple spells only costs 1 Stamina! 

For range, take the Basic Range above and plug it into "r" in the table.
For the AOE radius, take the half of Basic Range (unless stated otherwise).
0 range is a touch spell.

To start, take 9 Tier I spells from the list below.

# Spellcasting

| Class Level | Max Spell Tier | Total Spells Known | Basic Range (r) | Max Concentration | Max Concentration Time |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1           | I              | 9                  | 20              | 1                 | 10 min                 |
| 2           | II             | 15                 | 30              | 2                 | 30 min                 |
| 3           | III            | 21                 | 50              | 3                 | 1 hr                   |
| 4           | III            | All                | 50              | 5                 | 3 hr                   |

Max Concentration means how many spells you can have up at the same time and still cast other spells, and Max Concentration Time is how long any given Concentration spell can be up. Concentration spells are ones that can be kept up for a period of time but there are several things that will probably break your Concentration:
- A Failure on a Medium Risk Action
- A Mixed Success or worse on a High Risk Action
- Taking a Severe Injury or worse

Getting a Success on an Extreme Risk Action or doing a Suicidal Risk Action at all might even break your Concentration, so try to avoid risky Actions entirely if you want to keep you Concentration up.

## Spellcasting Styles

Pick a spellcasting style:

- Chroma Generalist: get +1d Mastery Die to the Action Roll if the previously-used spell was of the opposite color (red and blue are opposites, green and gray are opposites)
- Chroma Specialist: get +1d Mastery Die to the Action Roll if the previously-used spell was of the same color
	- Also removes the Red Heat spell cooldown
- AOE Caster: get +1d Mastery Die to the Action Roll if the spell is an AOE
- Single-Target Caster: get +1d Mastery Die to the Action Roll if the spell has one target
