# Intro

Stat: Any

You've made a pact with a dark god or other dark entity! Ooooh, spoooooky. Choose a god from the entity list or pick a dark immortal, evil dragon, or demon.

Very few warlocks are good, as dark entities often require some act of great evil in order to gain their power, or commit to some evil path. On the other hand, you might have a goal in common with them. Determine what your god requires, and what they might be driving you towards.

You may always pray to your god to ask them for guidance or aid, which they may or may not answer given their nature or the type of request. Be careful not to have your god solve your character's problems for them! Sometimes all they need is guidance.

Dealing yourself damage as part of your Warlock abilities cannot be blocked by any sort of shield!
