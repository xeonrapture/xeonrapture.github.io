# Intro

Stat: Vigor, Endurance, or Intuition

You've made a pact with a titan. Hmmmmmm, iiiinteresting. Choose a titan from the entity list or make your own (titans coming soon).

Your eyes turn a solid color, with no whites, pupil, or iris.

You can now transmute and morph objects and substances! Including your body!

Demititans can change elements and objects into different shapes and other elements. They can change the element of their own body and then change matter outside their body into that element through touch. There is no ranged transmuting! You have to be touching something to transmute it. 

Small amounts of matter outside your body are easy to quickly transmute or morph, but anything more than what's listed in the abilities below will probably take more than just an Action to transmute (and for very large amounts it can be up to hours and hours). 

Transmuting or morphing large amounts of matter is still done by touch: you keep contact with whatever you're transmuting or morphing as the change seeps through the material.

Feel free to pick an aesthetic theme for when you morph into whatever element such as a form the elements you morph take or a certain color you change all the substances you influence.

## Empowered Immaterial Mode

When you hit Level 6 you may now attack, cast spells, and do abilities while you're immaterial! But as soon as you attack, cast a spell, or do an ability you become half-material for 10 minutes, taking half damage from all sources.

# Substances

Non-transmutables are substances and objects that can't be transmuted unless you spend a large amount of time and effort transmuting them. Semi-transmutables are substances and objects that take 10x the time to transmute because of the substance or the stresses they're under.

Non-transmutables:

- gems
- protected or shielded objects (with tech or magic)
- processed materials (plastics, rubbers)
- strong magic or tech items
- the body of any living being besides you (plants don't count)

Semi-transmutables:

- objects and materials under a large amount of strain (foundations of a building, support struts of a spaceship)
