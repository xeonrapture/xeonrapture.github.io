# Intro

Stat: Any

Sorcerers are people who have made a pact or some deep bond with a devil.

Devils are spirits that arise because of a coalescence of strong emotions (such as from an intense event or a person's experiences over time). As the ambient xeon starts reacting to the emotions of the mortals that surround an intense event or location it starts forming into a spirit that reflects the nature of those emotions. It can then grow in intelligence, learning from the xeon around it and the mortals it comes in contact with.

Over time devils can get powerful enough to be able to interact with the physical world, at which point they can grow to help or hurt, destroy or fabricate.

Some devils get intelligent enough that they can enter pacts with mortals. Other devils (often called wraiths) attach to a mortal early on and start following them around. These pacted devils can then grant the mortal some of their powers, and in return the devils often gain power and intelligence just from being around their mortal and interacting with the mortal realm.

# Making a Devil

The sorcerer class is unique in that it's extremely customizable. Below is the mechanical framework for how it will work, but you get to create a devil that ties into your backstory. Here are some guidelines:

- They can look humanoid or they can look the farthest thing away from humanoid as there is, but their form _has_ to be informed by the event or emotions that formed them.
- They can be evil, they can be good, but more often they're neutral; their goals are formed by the event or emotion that formed them.
- Many devils will enter a pact in exchange for a sacrifice from a mortal. 
	- This sacrifice can be something physical like a finger, an eye, or even an appendage; it can be ethereal like requiring you to do a certain ritual or routine every day to feed them or take care of them; and it can even be something metaphysical like years off of your life. 
	- Sometimes devils will enter pacts for no apparent reason, and with no sacrifice required, or with the stipulation that you work with them to achieve some goal. 
	- Confer with your gm to figure out why your devil would enter a pact, whether formally or informally.
- Devils can even be condensed into or manifest as a physical object that you use as a weapon or a tool (such as a sword, a cloak, a piece of jewelry, etc.).
- If you need ideas just check out Jujutsu Kaisen or Chainsaw Man devils, or spirits from Princess Mononoke and other Miyazaki films, or use the [[#Devil Feature Rolling Tables|rolling tables below]] to generate one at random

# Devil Emotion

Here are some devil emotions and their special abilities; make sure to give them a specific aesthetic and personality.

> [!NOTE]
> For all Devil abilities, if you see something like "1d MD / 2d MD / 3d MD" that's the levelling up progression, so you get the first option at Level 1, second at Level 2, etc.
> 
> So "Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3"

This is also a rolling table if you decide to make things random; roll a d12 and take the emotion you roll.

| #   | Devil Emotion    | Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 3   | Anger            | Rage: can do a 3/4/5 dmg attack 3/day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4   | Grief            | Numbness: you numb the emotions and senses of a target, making them deal -1/-2/-3 dmg for the next 10 min.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5   | Protectiveness   | Sacrifice: take up to 1/2/3 dmg to block up to x3 that dmg done to your allies in the next 10 minutes. Can block Critical Injuries.

| 9   | Anxiety          | Preparation: get a bank of 3d Mastery Die that you or any of your allies can use any time during the day.

| 10  | Shame            | Disappear: You go invisible for up to 1/3/6 hours. You go visible if you attack or do any ability that costs stamina.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 11  | Love             | Selflessness: heal someone other than yourself up to 3/5/7 HP's worth of Injuries. At lvl 3 this ability can also heal Critical Injuries.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12  | Disgust          | Revulsion: a wave of force comes out of you, pushing everything up to 30/50/70 ft away. At lvl 3 you can choose any number of targets within this range to not feel this effect.                                                                                                                                     |

Your devil also doesn't necessarily need to be *predominantly* tied to the emotion you chose for your devil above, but there should be some link there. 

For example, if a devil was created from a massacre then you may choose Anger, Grief, Anxiety, Shame, Fear, or even Protectiveness depending on what angle you want to take. 

The devil's design and the powers it gives you should be influenced by what event created it and what emotion you picked, but it doesn't mean that the devil is a "Fear Devil" or an "Anger Devil", just that it's a devil created by that event and that the emotion you picked influenced its creation.

See for rolling tables that you can use to randomize or give you ideas for how your devil looks and how it was created.


# Powers

At lvl 1 Sorcerer you take the lvl 1 Standard Power and pick four of the Specialized Powers below. Pick ones that match your devil's personality and vibes and theme them to match! 

For example if you have a pact with a devil that's covered in tentacles, maybe you grow tentacles to use your powers. Or if your devil is made from darkness then you can conjure that same energy. Go crazy!

Generally your devil doesn't act for you (like Mystics who send out spirits to do their bidding), the devil is acting with you, granting you powers, and merging their xenic vitality with yours, though not usually possessing you or actually inhabiting your space.

Some abilities level up as you grow in power (Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3).

| Devil Form     | 3   | You merge with your devil, granting you their powers and abilities and giving you a +2d Mastery Dice for anything you do during the duration. Basically go wild with this, whatever makes sense in context is great. <br>While this is active, however, the devil might be trying to get into your ear and get you to do certain things, or their personality and appetites might heavily affect yours. <br>Lasts up to 10 minutes and can only be used 3 times a day. |

# Devil Feature Rolling Tables

If you don't feel like coming up with a devil from scratch or if you want to inject a bit of randomness into your devil I've included some random rolling tables to make it easier!

## Origin

What kind of event or location created this devil? Your character doesn't necessarily need a connection to this origin, there just needs to be a reason that the devil gravitated to your character.

| #   | Origin                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Small town suffered a massacre.                                                                                           |
| 2   | Your childhood friend died and their spirit and your memory of them turned into a devil.                                  |
| 3   | Venerated shrine near a lake in the mountains generated a devil.                                                          |
| 4   | The local cult's fervor and desperation coalesced into a devil.                                                           |
| 5   | Devil made from the feelings of loss for a stillborn child.                                                               |
