# Intro

Stat: Any

You've made a pact with a light god or other powerful light entity! Impressive, congrats. Choose a god from the entity list or pick an immortal or dragon.

Often clerics need to go down some good path in order to gain their heavenly power. Would the god you made a pact with require a daily ritual, a general walk of life, or a certain amount of good deeds per week? They might be lenient or strict, but that's up to you.

You may always pray to your god to ask them for guidance or aid, which they may or may not answer given their nature or the type of request. Be careful not to have your god solve your character's problems for them! Sometimes all they need is guidance. This type of prayer doesn't cost Stamina.

| Target Heal              | 1   | You heal a target a moderate mount, can close wounds but can't heal strong illnesses or maimings (can heal Minor Injuries and the Minor Curse Severe Injury).                      |
| Seal Spirit              | 1   | You may attempt to seal away a spirit or end a possession; your ability to seal away a being depends on your overall level, the strength of your will, or the purity of your soul. |
| Communicate with Spirits | 1   | You may see into the xenic plane and speak to spirits (lasts 10 min).                                                                                                              |

| Hamper Enemy             | 2   | You may cleanse an enemy with holy light, making it easier to hit them and harder for them to hit you (next Action done against them is done with +2d Mastery Dice).               |
| Group Heal               | 2   | You can now do an AOE heal up to 10 ft around you (heal up to 3 HP's worth of Injuries distributed any way you want among your allies; you cannot heal Critical Injuries).         |
| Protect                  | 3   | Protect yourself or an ally with a holy shield (ignore the next damage they would take, even if it's a Critical Injury).                                                           |
| Bolster                  | 3   | Energize yourself or your allies (next Action you or your ally does gets a bonus of +3d Mastery dice)                                                                              |
| Cleanse                  | 3   | You may cleanse Minor Spirit Decay and the Major Curse Critical Injury.                                                                                                            |

Pick an entity to make a pact with from the list below and give yourself the ability that corresponds to the god you picked below! If you picked an immortal you may either take one of the abilities below or make one up that seems reasonable to you.

# Light Gods

Here are listed the Light Gods you can make a pact with. You get the same ability whether you pick the higher-level god or one of the lesser gods beneath them.

These are all Archonic gods. Eosian Gods will just give you elemental spirits to work with, they won't make pacts with you themselves.

If you can think of a power that fits better for your character than the ones below, go for it! Just make sure it isn't game-breakingly powerful.
