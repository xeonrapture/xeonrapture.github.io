So normally when you go down you're just incapacitated with no threat of death. BUT if you ever take a critical injury then when you go down you go unconscious and start dying!

Whenever you take a critical injury that means that whatever hit you will probably leave a scar of some sort (provided you survive your death saves). Think about what kind of scar your character would have, physical or mental, and what it would look like and how you could integrate it into your character's conception about themselves.

Do critical injury checks at the top of the team turn.

If you roll your critical injury and are stable that clears the critical injury from you, and you also gain the 3 health that you lost when you took the critical injury. You still stay unconscious, however!

It takes a good meal and a full night of sleep to heal one Critical Injury, and if you have multiple you must take multiple days to heal those Injuries.

# Normal
## Bleeding Out

Roll a d10 each turn:
- Every roll 1-5 counts as a failure and every roll 6-10 counts as a success. 
- Three failures = you die, and three successes = you're stable!

## Blunt Trauma

Roll 3d6 every turn: 
- 1s count as failures and 6s count as successes! 
- Three failures = you die, and three successes = you're stable.

## Stamina Exhaustion

The only Critical Injury that goes away with a Deep Rest.

You can't die from the Stamina Exhaustion Critical Injury, but when you take it you have to Succeed on a Kinda Easy (DC 15) Action with your main Stat +1d Mastery Die or else go unconscious. If you Succeed that check then after you spend another 5 Stamina you now have to Succeed on a Hard (DC 20) Action to stay awake, and the DC goes up by 5 for every 5 Stamina you spend.

If anybody tries to heal you or does any sort of action to bring you back after you go unconscious from this Critical Injury then *they* have to Succeed at the Action that you just Failed in order to bring you back up (e.g. you failed a Tricky DC 30 Action to stay awake, so you go unconscious, and your ally wants to bring you back up so now *they* have to beat a Tricky DC 30 Action to bring you back to consciousness). If you're doing this with healing you get a plus to this check equal to the HP you're healing.

Healing still heals the damage you've taken, but nothing can bring you back to consciousness but a successful Action against the DC to bring you back or you finishing a Deep Rest, which resets your Stamina Used and clears this Critical Injury.

# Intense
## Bleeding Out FAST

Roll a d10 each turn: 
- Every roll 1-5 counts as a failure and every roll 6-10 counts as a success. 
- TWO failures = you die, and three successes = you're stable!

## VERY Blunt Trauma

Roll 3d6 every turn: 
- 1s count as failures and 6s count as successes! 
- TWO failures = you die, and three successes = you're stable.

## Withering

Have to crit on a d8.

Every turn you roll the d8 the number you die at creeps up, starting at 1, then moving to 2, then to 3, etc. 

If you ever roll at or below the death number then you die, and if you ever roll an 8 you're stable, just unconscious.

## Necrosis

Have to crit on a d8, and if that doesn't work you try on a d10 next turn, then on a d12 the turn after that, and finally a d20.

If you fail on a d20 you die.

## Maimed

Use this for a deep, deep wounds or getting crushed by something massive.

Maimed is the rare Critical Injury in which there isn't a huge chance of dying.

Roll a 1d6. If you don't get surgical medical attention within 1d4 hours the results are permanent (and for a 1 you're dead). 
	- 6=right leg maimed
	- 5=left leg maimed
	- 4=right arm maimed
	- 3=left arm maimed
	- 2=spine broken
	- 1=head broken

## Major Curse

Oof.

Per day your max HP goes down by 1. If it ever reaches 0 you die.

If you ever get knocked out you don't die just get incapacitated, you can only die from a Major Curse by getting your max HP reduced to 0.

Cannot be removed by anything but the curse being cleansed.

## Disease and Poison

### Deterioration

You are immediately stable, but incapacitated. Do a 1d4 roll per hour, and on 3 1s you die. You must find a cure or other intense medical attention!

### Deep Disease

Roll a 1d4, on a 1 you instantly die, otherwise you're fine, the Critical Injury goes away, and just unconscious until your healed.

### Brutal Poison

You remain conscious but in immense pain. You must make an End Action against the poison or disease itself every 10 minutes.

The disease or poison has a minimum of 20 Difficulty (or higher if it's an even nastier poison) and you take 1 point of Poison on Success, 2 on Mixed Success, and 3 on Failure (you remove 1 point of Poison on Strong Success) . As soon as the Poison wraps around your health again, you die.

You must find a cure, have someone cure you, or get the poison out somehow.

# Death Blows
These are for wraparound dmg, when you get knocked unconscious and the leftover dmg would destroy entirety of your HP again, for Failing on a super risky check, or getting destroyed by something extremely powerful and dangerous like a god.

## Demolished

For physical sources of dmg.

Roll 1d20. 
- On a 20 you suffer the blunt trauma critical injury above. 
- On a 19 you survive but permanently maimed (roll on maim table). 
- On 2-18 you instantly die. 
- On a 1 you instantly die *and* your spirit anchor is also destroyed. 

## Obliterated

For xenic sources of dmg.

Roll 1d10
- On a 10 you suffer the blunt trauma critical injury above. 
- On 2-9 you are instantly disintegrated. 
- On a 1 you are instantly disintegrated *and* your spirit anchor is also destroyed.

## Disintegrated

For insane amounts of dmg, gods deciding to unmake you, that sort of stuff.

Roll a 1d100.
- On a 100 you suffer the Maimed critical injury above. 
- On all other numbers you and your spirit anchor are completely destroyed.
