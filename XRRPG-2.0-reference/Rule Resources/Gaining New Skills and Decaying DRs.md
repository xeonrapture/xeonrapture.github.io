# General
Throughout your adventure you may work to gain new skills (as directed by the GM).

To gain a new skill or improve an existing skill, set a Decaying DR of 40 (or 60 for an existing skill). Every time you practice this skill you subtract the roll you got (plus that stat bonus that you're using *and* the skill bonus you already have, if you're improving an existing skill) from the Decaying DR. When the DR gets to 0, you gain a new skill with a +2 bonus (or a +1 to the existing skill).

You can only practice the skill once or maybe twice a day.

There is a +5 cap for each individual skill, but you can have as many skills as you'd like, and you shouldn't be working on more than one or maybe two Decaying DRs at a time. 

For some Decaying DRs, you won't even know what the cap is! This is when you're trying to solve a problem or puzzle whose complexity is extreme or whose difficulty is uncertain (such as decoding an ancient language or trying to figure out something that no one has ever figured out before). They may not have caps at all (e.g. the problems are unsolvable)! Sometimes they will only gain a cap once something has happened in the story that makes it possible for you to solve the problem.

GMs may refuse to let you upgrade a skill if they feel like it would start breaking the game. Battle abilities are generally not able to be upgraded.
