Cyborgs are people who have started to become technology.

# Styles of Mods

- Basic: fairly low price, but they look pretty cheap. Nuts and bolts.
- High-end: fine tech, takes inspiration from bio, self healing and more tough and efficient than bio, and has senses like bio
	- There's also high end that is just metal, but it blends in more (like cyberpunk mods), from a different company
- Exozinik: all held together with xeon binding, very expensive, custom-made for you
- Pbosh: heavy metals, the most durable, high level of craftsmanship
- Rtolkan (Retrotech): basically steampunk
- Magic: can make mods with magic items, but its less common. Also there are magic golems what are basically cyborgs but magical, but also less common

# Cybermods

Most of these cybermods take stamina to use! You may use wit for any check to use a cybermod; other than that, cybermods use the stat that makes the most sense for whatever check you're doing (and that will often mean you have multiple to choose from).

All higher-tier cybermods *replace* their lower-tier counterpart (unless the higher-tier mod will be installed into a different place as the lower-tier mod)!
