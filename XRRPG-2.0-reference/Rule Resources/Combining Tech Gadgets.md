# Combining Gadgets

- you can combine gadgets if you end up with multiple technologist classes. this doesn't modify their abilities at all, it just combines them into one object. the limits on gadget amounts still apply (a gunsword counts as both one of your guns and one of your swords)
- you can only combine one of each type of gadget! and you can't combine two of the same type unless otherwise stated
	- so like no combining a bomb with another bomb or a sword with another sword
- explosives
	- Explosives that deal damage from an Explosive Expert will destroy the object it's combined with if activated!
	- Explosives that deal damage will also hurt you if activated next to you
	- bomb-thrower guns use the same stats as the Cannon in the Explosive Expert class. You have to load them with bombs that you create
- gunslinger
	- Emitter Guns make your guns able to shoot your emitters
	- GUNSWORDS don't shoot swords! they're guns and also swords
- If you throw an Emitter Sword, you can then call them back to you like you can with an Emitter!
- Dronemaster cannot be combined with Brawler or Swordmaster because frankly that'd be too powerful (making brawler or swords ranged is toooo much)
