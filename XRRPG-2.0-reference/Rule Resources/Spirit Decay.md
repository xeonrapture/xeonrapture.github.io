# Intro

Spirit decay is what happens when you push your xenic spirit too hard, and is a side-effect of pushing past your limits too many times.

Also called xenic decay! Especially in techie places.

People who can see spirits or has xeon sensing notice your aura change when you have spirit decay, and there can be other physical effects depending on how far gone you are.

# Gaining Spirit Decay

You get spirit decay either by dying and getting recorped, by pushing your powers beyond your stamina, or by spending too long in a place that'll give you spirit decay.

Warlocks, necromancers, and very powerful sorcerers have a high risk of incurring xenic decay, and you can also get it from evil areas and cursed items.

The more times you incur spirit decay the worse it gets: the first time you cleanse spirit decay, all the decay is gone no matter how much decay you had, but the next time you get a level of spirit decay you skip right to the second level. You always skip to the level of spirit decay equal to *how many times you've been cleansed*. Your spirit remembers the effects of the decay and is permanently affected.

Some powerful beings can do a sort of **deep clean**, resetting your spirit so that you start at level 1 the next time you get spirit decay! They gotta be *powerful* though, like Lower God level at least.

# Minor Spirit Decay

All of these effects are permanent until the spirit decay is cleansed (unless stated otherwise).

If you roll the same effect again on the same spirit decay you either lengthen the time that it happens for or just do the same effect again.

## 100

Roll a d10. On a 10 you are subject to the [[Critical Injuries#Death Blows|Obliterated]] Critical Injury and deal 6d8 damage to all those in a 50 ft circle around you as your body and spirit combust. If you roll anything other than a 10 you instantly fall unconscious and are subject to the [[Critical Injuries#More Intense|Withering]] Critical Injury as your spirit attempts to leave your body. If you die of either of these Critical Injuries your body incinerates into dust and your spirit disintegrates into pure xeon.

# Getting Rid of Spirit Decay

It gets harder and harder to really get the spirit decay out the more you get. There are a couple of ways to deal with it.

## Suppressing

Suppressing spirit decay effects ONLY REMOVES THE EFFECTS, NOT THE DECAY ITSELF, and only temporarily. It can be a good idea, however, when the effects get really bad and you need to function until you can really take care of the decay itself.

Certain items can suppress the effects of spirit decay temporarily, as can certain powerful machines, or potent tech consumables.

The absolute WORST way is to suppress only the physical effects with drugs and chemicals; this has the potential to harm your body and *also* not really get rid of the effects.

## Burning It In

You can burn in your spirit decay effects at any time, getting rid of the spirit decay but making the effects of that spirit decay permanent. Useful for when you have a ton of spirit decay and there's imminent risk of getting more. Can be a very strong character decision.

## Cleansing

Certain classes can often cleanse the effects of spirit decay, but the more intense the effects get the crazier the methods you have to go to to expunge the effects. See the table above for more info.
