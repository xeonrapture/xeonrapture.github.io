# Local Node Shop

Any time the party enters their Local Node (as long as some webrunning or out-of-web adventuring has been done) the Local Node Shop will refresh. 

The shop uses the highest Luck stat of anybody in the party to generate as many pieces of gear as there are members of the party, which can then be bought with essence or credits.

| Rarity    | Essence Cost | Credit Cost |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Common    | 500          | 50          |
| Uncommon  | 1000         | 100         |
| Rare      | 2000         | 200         |
| Epic      | 5000         | 500         |
| Legendary | 10000        | 1000        |

Essence and Credits can be transferred back and forth at a 10:1 ratio at the Local Node Shop.

## Shop Refreshing

Essence can also be spent to refresh the shop manually (if the GM is rolling gear manually then they can decide to make the shop not refresh at all so they don't have to roll gear a thousand times in a row).

| Shop <br>Refresh<br>Count | Essence <br>Cost |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1                         | 500              |
| 2                         | 1000             |
| 3                         | 1500             |
| 4                         | 2000             |
| 5                         | 3000             |
| 6                         | 5000             |
| 7                         | 7500             |
| 8                         | 10000            |
| 9+                        | +10000           |

- Shop Base Luck is *in addition* to the highest luck of anybody in the party!
- Shop Gear Amount (or the pieces of Gear that the shop generates) starts equal to the amount of members that are in your party.

# Gear Upgrading

While in your Local Node you can choose to spend essence to upgrade existing gear!

Make sure you don't go over [[#Gear Maxes]] while upgrading.

Upgrading entails:
- Getting new modifiers:
	- Rolling for a new Color Stat Buff
	- Rolling for either a new Active or Passive
- Upgrading Stat Buffs by going to the [[#Stat Buff Table]] and moving the Stat Buff to the new rarity value on the chart (it will regenerate the stat based on your current Luck stat)
	- If the previous Stat Buff is higher than the upgraded one then take the higher number! Really only applicable if the piece of gear was initially generated with bonus Luck.
- Upgrading Actives and Passives by moving them to the next tier of rarity

| Upgrade            | Additional <br>Color Stat Buff | Additional <br>Actives or Passives | Essence Cost |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Common -> Uncommon | +1                             | -                                  | 1000         |
| Uncommon -> Rare   | +1                             | +1 Active                          | 2000         |
| Rare -> Epic       | +1                             | -                                  | 5000         |
| Epic -> Legendary  | +1                             | +1 Active                          | 10000        |

# Rerolling Gear Modifiers

At your Local Node you can choose to completely reroll the Stat Buffs, Actives, and Passives of an item you already own.

Make sure that the piece of gear ends up with as many Stat Buffs, Actives, and Passives as it had before the reroll. 

Rerolling uses whatever your Luck stat is when it's initiated, so your new stats will scale with Luck.

Also make sure that if you've condensed Stat Buffs and Actives into the piece of gear that what you reroll for those condensed modifiers are of the same color or category as the original modifiers (e.g. if you condense a Green Stat Buff into a Red piece of gear make sure that you reroll another Green Stat Buff to replace the original).

| Reroll    | Essence Cost |
| --------- | ------------ |
| Common    | 250          |
| Uncommon  | 500          |
| Rare      | 1000         |
| Epic      | 2500         |
| Legendary | 5000         |

# Gear Condensing

At your Local Node you can choose to destroy a piece of gear and move a portion of their Stat Buffs, Actives, and/or Passives to a new piece of gear.

Make sure you don't exceed the Gear Maxes below when condensing! 

You *cannot* duplicate Stat Buffs that are exactly the same or are different tiers of the same Stat Buff (such as Attack Plus and Attack Plus ✦).

## Condensing Costs

On the table below, the numbers on top are how many modifiers are being moved from the gear being condensed to the gear receiving the modifiers.

| Gear <br>Receiving | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Common             | 125  | 250  | -    | -     | -     | -     | -     |
