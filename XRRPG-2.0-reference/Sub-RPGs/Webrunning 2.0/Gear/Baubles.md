# Intro

Baubles are odds and ends, random items that either give you stat buffs and other effects while they sit in your personal Inventory or that are more valuable or more important than any old item.

Baubles don't give you any benefits if they're in your Home Node Inventory.

To start, roll on this table to determine the type of Bauble you get.

| #   | Bauble Type |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | Diamond     |
| 2   | Orb         |
| 3   | Trinket     |
| 4   | Egg         |
| 5   | Knicknack   |
| 6   | Curio       |
| 7   | Key Item    |
| 8   | Reroll      |

# Bauble Types

## Diamond

Diamonds are Baubles that give you one stat buff but whose stat buffs don't collapse down when you get them; e.g. they keep scaling with your Luck stat as it increases.

To make a Diamond, roll on the [[Gear Generation#Stat Buff Table|Stat Buff Table]] for the color of the Diamond, and then roll on the [[#Diamond, Orb, and Egg Aesthetic|table below]] for aesthetic (normal gear aesthetic does not apply).

Color Mix Diamonds give you two stat buffs, one for each color!

## Orb

Orbs are Baubles that give you one stat buff but whose stat buffs don't collapse down when you get them AND they scale with *how many pieces of gear of their color you have equipped*.

To make an Orb, roll on the [[Gear Generation#Stat Buff Table|Stat Buff Table]] for the color of the Orb, substituting the L (for luck) with G (which equals how many pieces of gear of its color you have equipped, including Kernels). Then roll on the [[#Diamond, Orb, and Egg Aesthetic|table below]] for aesthetic (normal gear aesthetic does not apply).

Color Mix Orbs give you two stat buffs, one for each color, and each of which scale on how many pieces of gear of each color you have equipped! Make sure to scale the Color 1 Stat Buff with how many pieces of gear you have equipped of that color, and same with Color 2.

## Trinket

Trinkets are Baubles that give you a bonus to an adventuring skill! These also do not collapse and the buff they give increases as your Luck does. 

Roll skill buff below, and then roll on the [[#Trinket/Knickknack, Curio, and Key Item Aesthetic|table below]] for aesthetic (normal gear aesthetic does not apply).

## Egg

Eggs hatch into a piece of gear that is one level of rarity higher than the Egg itself. Eggs have to be in your Inventory as you gain XP, and when you gain a certain amount of XP with the Egg in your Inventory it hatches.

Legendary Eggs hatch into two Legendary pieces of gear!

To make an egg, roll a d6 and if you roll a 5 you randomize everything about the piece of gear (ignoring the color that you rolled earlier, essentially), and if you roll a 6 reroll. All other Eggs hatch into a piece of gear that matches their color. After this, roll on the [[#Diamond, Orb, and Egg Aesthetic|table below]] for aesthetic (normal gear aesthetic does not apply).

| Rarity    | XP to Hatch |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Common    | 5           |
| Uncommon  | 10          |
| Rare      | 15          |
| Epic      | 20          |
| Legendary | 25          |

## Knickknack

Knickknacks are Baubles that give you a small, usually non-combat ability.
