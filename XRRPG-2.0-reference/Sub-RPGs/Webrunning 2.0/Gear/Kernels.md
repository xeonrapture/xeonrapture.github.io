# General

Roll a Passive for the color of Kernel you get.

When you roll a Passive you *only* get the Passive for the Rarity of your item! This is different from Actives, where you get access to all tiers below the Rarity of the item.

Unless stated otherwise all Passives can only be done during combat.

## Node Map

A very vague map is basically an outline of what kinds of things to expect in what area of the node (no room details, no secrets, no enemy positions).

Secrets can be anything: a hidden loot drop, a piece of important or rare gear, a hidden room, a bit of information or a hint of what's coming up next.

Note to GMs: don't feel like you need to draw a map for every node just for this Passive; give enough details to satisfy the Passive but there's no need to get too detailed.
