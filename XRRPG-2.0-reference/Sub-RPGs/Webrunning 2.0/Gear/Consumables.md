# Intro

Consumables are items that are used for things like healing, temporary stat buffs, and shop upgrades. Consumables destroy themselves upon use!

First of all, roll on the table below to determine what type of Consumable you get, then roll on the Aesthetic table farther down to determine what the Consumable looks like.

All Consumables cost an Energy of any color to use if consumed in combat.

Consumables cannot level up!

Gear Change Consumables can only be used on Gear that has the same or lower Rarity.

- Gear Type Change Consumables let you change a piece of Gear to a type that you decide (reroll all Abilities and Stat Buffs)
- Gear Color Change Consumables let you change a piece of Gear to a color that you decide (reroll all Abilities and Stat Buffs)

# Respec Stats

You may shuffle your Basic Stats (Power, Defense, Speed, Intelligence) any way you like! Make sure to not reallocate any Basic Stat Buffs given by Gear.

In addition, higher rarities give you additional Basic Stat points to spend. If you get a Rare or higher Respec Stats Consumable you can choose to not move your stats around at all and just add the points you've been given.
