# Intro

Gear Actives level up as the Gear itself levels up, and you always have access to lower tiers of an Active that you have (e.g. if you have Fireball IV then you also have access to Fireball III, II, and I).

You can only use each Tier of a given Active once per turn unless stated otherwise!

Unless otherwise stated, the range of all abilities equals your Range Stat and AOE radius of all abilities equals your Perception Stat.

Neutral Actives can take any color of Energy, but all other Actives must take Energy that matches their color or one of their colors.

Combo attacks apply the applicable Passives of all participants!

Stat debuffs applied to enemies and stat buffs applied to yourself can only apply once per Active (e.g. if you hit with two different Tiers of the same Active it doesn't apply the stat debuffs more than once, it just takes the higher of the two). Stat buffs from different Tiers of the same Active can apply to separate allies.

Status Effect stacks, on the other hand, apply every time an Active or Passive says they apply.
