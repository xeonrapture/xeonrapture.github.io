# Intro

So you went to a cybermodder and got a Starter Mod installed so you can run the web, huh? You think you're gonna be a big shot, collecting gear, hacking your enemies and stealing their secrets, huh? Well it's not gonna be all that easy.

Webrunning is a brutal game, clearing node after node, running up against firewalls, viruses, hostile AIs, and violent traps. Each run you may get the gear you want, slowly becoming a powerhouse, gaining power to demolish your enemies and raking in the credits, or you might get destroyed, lose all the gear and essence you collected that run, and be forced to run back to your home node, tail between your legs.

Each run is different. Gear is randomized. Every runner starts the same, but only a select few reach the top.

## Arriving on the Web

When you first connect that big cable to the plug at the base of your neck you'll be beamed into your home node, which is a place that you can make look however you like.

You also have full control over what your character looks like; you can look exactly like your character outside the web or completely different. 

Looking out of your node you see a net of twisting gray lines with the occasional flash of color, all connecting, pulsing, shifting information between nodes. When you enter a node you enter a whole new world, all depending on which one you choose.

Check here for more info on the [[Hikari Lore Drop#The Gray Web|gray web]].

Your body needs significantly less food and water while you're webrunning but if you're doing it for long enough you'll need an IV drip or some machine to keep you nourished or healed up; if you stay in for long enough without nourishment you'll lose health constantly until you hit 0 HP.

If you ever hit 0 HP in the real world (by malnourishment or somebody damaging you) then you're immediately ripped out of webrunning and back into your body, losing all gear and essence you gained during that run.

# Basic Mechanics

On the web, roll with a d20 when doing any checks.

Whenever you want to do something hard you roll (called "doing a check") and add the plus from whatever Basic Stat you're using on the check. The GM will determine a DC (Difficulty Class), a number that you have to hit in order to succeed on the check. If you meet or beat the DC then you succeed on the check and do what you set out to do!

Checks can be done during combat as well as while you adventure on the web.

## Stats

Your webrunning character has stats that are pretty different from stats in the real world but still share the same color-coding. 

At level 1 all Basic Stats start at 0 and then you add 3 points into whichever ones you'd like.

Neutral Stats increase as you level up and Secondary Stats are derived from your Basic Stats and increase as you increase them. All Stats can be increased by certain pieces of Gear.

Some Stats are *Limited*: see the [[#Stat Limits]] section below Leveling Up for what these Limits are per level.

### Neutral Stats

All Neutral Stats' starting Base Values are determined by looking at the [[#Leveling Up]] chart below.

| HP<br><br>*Limited* | Neutral | When you take damage your HP reduces, and when your HP hits 0 you become a cyberghost. HP scales a little bit as you level up, and some gear gives HP as well.                          |

| XP                  | Neutral | Gain XP equal to node danger level each time you clear a node. Clearing means overcoming the main obstacle, not necessarily looting it entirely. Hit certain XP thresholds to level up. |

| Stat              | Type     | Details                                                                                                                    |

## Leveling Up

At level 1 you start with 0 to every Basic Stat and add 3 points to whichever Basic Stats you'd like. There is no stat cap!

You always have Home Node Storage Slots equal to 3x your personal Inventory Slots.

See [[#Gaining XP]] for instructions on how and when to gain XP.

### Stat Limits

Because gear is randomized there are Limits on certain stats so that no one character gets too ahead of everyone else. 

These Limits take effect after all Gear Plusses and only limit how the stat *affects* you or how much damage an enemy takes; they don't truncate the stat itself, so if you have a higher Stat then the Limit and you level up then your stat will increase.

These Limits are hard caps: any shop- or drop-specific Luck bonuses or Temp Buffs or any non-gear plusses apply **before** the Limits.

| Level | Max<br>HP<br>Limit | Defense<br>DC<br>Limit | Single<br>Attack <br>Damage<br>Limit | Total<br>Combo<br>Damage<br>Limit | Luck<br>Limit |

# Gear

At Level 1 grab all the Basic Gear from [[Basic Webrunning Gear|here]].

Gear is what makes your character powerful, and can be bought from shops, collected from chests during a run, or scrounged from the remains of a virus or firewall you just destroyed.

You only have so many slots for gear, so you'll have to make choices on how you want to build your character and what role you want your character to play in the party.

When you first enter your Local Node you will be given a Common One-Handed Weapon and two pieces of Common Clothing.

Gear can include several different types of bonuses and abilities:
- Stat Plus: a plus like increased Damage Plus or increased Perception.
- Active Abilities: attacks, effects, or other abilities you spend energy to use

Each piece of gear has a couple of different attributes:
- Type: what slot the gear can be equipped to (e.g. hats are Head gear, weapons can be Equipped, boots are Feet gear, etc.).
- Color: what color of Energy the gear requires to activate its Active abilities. Also determines what kind of stats the gear improves.
- Rarity: how common the gear is; the rarer the gear the more powerful it is.

For detailed Gear Generation and Modification click [[Gear Generation|here]].

## Gear Rarity

There are five different gear rarities: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary. As the rarity goes up, the better the Stat Buffs, the better the Actives and Passives. Higher-level gear often has multiple Actives and Stat Buffs.

Higher Luck increases your chances for getting higher-rarity Gear!

| Inventory (10+ slots)          | Inventory for Gear, Consumables, and Baubles. Can be increased by Gear and leveling up.                        |
| Local Node Storage (30+ slots) | Storage for Gear and stuff that's only accessible in your Home Node. Always equal to your Inventory Slots x3.  |

## Gear Color

Each of the following gear types have different types of abilities and take a certain color of Energy to use their Actives.

Certain items are color mixes, which are often more powerful and combine the characteristics of multiple colors.

| Gear Color | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Neutral    | Can consume any color of Energy for its Actives unless otherwise stated. <br><br>Neutral gear has Actives to deal with giving Energy and clearing up Status Effects.                              |
| Red        | Red gear consumes Red Energy for its Actives.<br><br>This gear affects Attack Plus and Damage Plus and is usually volatile and damage-heavy. It can also push and pull enemies and applies Burn.  |
| Blue       | Blue gear consumes Blue Energy for its Actives.<br><br>This gear affects HP, Defense DC, and Armor and can also Freeze enemies, attract attention, and protect allies.                            |
| Green      | Green gear consumes Green Energy for its Actives.<br><br>This gear affects Initiative, Movement Speed, Range and can heal self or allies, apply Poison, or do ranged damage.                      |
| Gray       | Gray gear consumes Gray Energy for its Actives.<br><br>This gear affects Perception and Hacking and can do intense AOE attacks, create clouds of darkness, and lets allies use their own Actives. |

## Essence

At any time when you get gear you can choose to break that gear down into essence. Essence can be used to buy new gear, level up or reroll your existing gear, or on certain Passives to help your runs go smoother.

At your home node you can break gear down into credits or transfer credits to essence and vice versa.

10 Essence = 1 Credit

| Rarity    | Essence Value | Credit Value |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Common    | 500           | 50           |
| Uncommon  | 1000          | 100          |
| Rare      | 2000          | 200          |
| Epic      | 5000          | 500          |
| Legendary | 10000         | 1000         |

## Your Local Node Shop

Upon entering your home node you'll have access to your local shop, where you can spend essence to buy new gear, level up your gear, reroll or transfer your existing gear's modifiers, and store gear in your Local Node Storage. The DM will generate random gear to put into the shop.

Throughout the Webrunning docs your Local Node is also sometimes referred to as your Home Node.

See here for more info: [[Gear Generation#Local Node Shop]]

## Drops

There are many ways to get gear as you traverse the web, including beating enemies, opening chests, hacking lockboxes, and finding shops.

Most drops come unformed and only become a piece of gear once touched. The process of turning a drop into a piece of gear is called "collapsing", because all the possibilities of the drop collapse down into the one piece of gear. 

Certain drops, such as from chests and powerful enemies, add their own luck to the drop when you collapse them (in addition to your personal Luck stat). Sometimes you'll find gear that has the rarity pre-set and will take the Luck stat of whoever collapses it for its stats.

Remember to only apply the Luck you get from a piece of gear *after* that loot drop is completely finished (e.g. the Luck from a piece of gear doesn't apply to any of the other loot that's dropped at the same time).

GMs: feel free to give out a lot of healing consumables, especially if the party seems to be struggling! But whatever works for the game you want to play.

### Combat Drops

When you beat an enemy they drop a glowing orb or another geometric shape that becomes a piece of gear when touched. These gear orbs only drop once the battle is done, and each member of the party can only touch one (so that everybody gets to use their Luck stat). Each piece of gear uses the Luck stat of the person who touches them to calculate Rarity and Stat Buffs.

All normal enemies drop one piece of gear, and powerful enemies will often drop a piece of gear per character.

Sometimes bosses will drop one additional piece gear that adds the luck of everyone in the party together and divides it by 2!

GMs: Feel free to not to randomly roll for certain pieces of gear if you think an enemy would drop a specific piece of gear! Making things more thematic can up the cohesion of the story.

### Chests

You can find random chests or lockboxes that contain rare loot! These chests will almost always have an Luck add (on top of the Luck of the player that opens them) and can be opened by a key, upon disarming a trap, or when you finish a combat encounter.

### Random Shops

Sometimes you'll find a person, AI, or program selling gear in a random node! These shops can stock specific consumables or pieces of gear, gear orbs of a certain rarity or with added luck, or even plot items that lead you to a certain node or unlock a part of the current node.

GMs feel free to roll the shop with a certain amount of Luck. In general the more dangerous or higher-level nodes should have better items, fuller shops, and/or an option for the shopkeeper to make a piece of gear to the players specifications.

# Combat

Combat is turn-based, where whoever has the highest Initiative stat goes first, followed by the second highest Initiative, etc. down to the lowest Initiative. On Initiative ties both people roll a d20 + Speed and highest of the two goes first.

You have 0 Energy out of combat. Combat ends when the killing blow is dealt to the final enemy.

## Turns

Each of your turns has three phases:

### Start Phase

1. Trigger all "Start Phase" Passives.
2. Gain Energy:
	- Gain Red Energy equal to your Power
	- Gain Blue Energy equal to your Defense
	- Gain Green Energy equal to your Speed
	- Gain Gray Energy equal to your Intelligence
	- If you end up with more Energy than your Energy Cap then you must discard Energy to get down to the Energy Cap. You can choose what colors of energy you keep.
3. Use as many tiles of your Movement Speed as you wish.

### Active Phase

The Active Phase is where you use Energy!

- Basic Attacks
	- You can do one Basic Attack per weapon during this phase. Roll a d20 and add *both* the Stat of your Weapon Color and your Attack Plus to your roll to hit. If you meet or beat your enemy's Defense DC then you hit and deal damage!
		- Red = Power, Blue = Defense, Green = Speed, Gray = Intelligence
		- For Neutral Weapons you can choose what Stat you use to hit.
		- For Mixed Color Weapons you can choose either of the two Stats for your Attack roll.
	- If you hit, deal damage by rolling your Weapon Damage Die and adding your Damage Plus.
		- Basic Attacks use one energy of any color of energy.
- Active Abilities
	- Active Abilities cost Energy to use.
	- You can only ever use each Active once per turn.
		- You *can* use different tiers of the same Active on any given turn.
- Other Actions (cost 1 Energy of any color)
	- Using a Consumable
	- Sending an item from your inventory to another players'
	- Swapping out gear (can unequip and equip to the same slot with 1 Energy)

You may save as much Energy between turns as you wish (as long is it doesn't go over your Energy Cap).

### End Phase

1. Spend any Movement Speed tiles that you have left over, if you wish.
2. Reduce each Status Effect by one.
3. Trigger all "End Phase" Passives.

## Movement

Every turn you can move as many tiles as you have Movement Speed. Tiles are measured the same perpendicularly as they are diagonally (a tile is only always just a tile, even though the distance is technically different).

## Status Effects

There are several Status Effects that you can apply and can be applied to you during combat; each one affects the target in a different way.

Unless otherwise stated, each of these Status Effects only apply if the attack hits.

Each time your End Phase comes around reduce each Status Effect applied to you by one.

- **Burn**: Each stack of Burn increases damage dealt to the target by 1.
- **Freeze**: Each stack of Freeze reduces Defense DC and Armor by 1.
- **Poison**: Each stack of Poison reduces Attack Plus and Damage Plus by 1.

## Misc. Rules

- Defending: When you're attacked an enemy will roll against your Defense DC, and if they meet or beat it they hit you and do damage.
- AOE: AOEs attacks (area of effects) are measured in radius, which turns into a square because diagonal tiles are measured the same as perpendicular ones.
- Cover: If you hide behind partial or full cover you can make it hard or impossible to hit you.
	- Half cover imposes disadvantage to the attacker's Attack Roll.
	- Full cover means you can't be targeted at all.
- Story Height: each story of a chamber or building is usually about two tiles high

## Becoming a Cyberghost

When you drop to 0 HP your cyberbody is dispersed and you come back as a cyberghost. 

As a cyberghost you can do the following:
- Communicate with your teammates
- Do Intelligence and Perception checks
- Add half your Speed stat (min of 1) to an ally's Initiative at the start of combat
- Add half your Defense stat (min of 1) to an ally's Defense DC once per round
- Add half your Power stat (min of 1) to an ally's Attack Roll once per round

When the group moves to another node your cyberbody rematerializes (but with half health)!

If your whole team goes down you return to your physical bodies and you drop all gear and essence you gained that run (though you can go retrieve everything you dropped if you can get back to the same place). 

You cannot be healed back from being a cyberghost without special healing consumables or tools!

# Adventuring

You get onto the web by hooking your mind up to a terminal (usually through a cyberport installed in your head), which then connects either to a nexus or directly to a node on the web. From the nexus or the node you can then travel to another node or nexus, or enter the space between them. Nexuses are hubs that have a bunch of nodes connected to them.

## Doing Checks

As you travel from node to node you'll run into traps, obstacles, social encounters, and all sorts of things that'll make the run interesting. When you are forced or decide to dp something hard you'll have to do a d20 check, adding whatever Basic Stat applies to the thing you're trying to do.

Whenever you're doing a check and an ally wants to help you they may do some action to make what you're doing easier, giving you Advantage (roll two d20 and take the highest). If what they're doing to try to help you is difficult itself it might warrant a check of its own.

Below is a rough guide to what kinds of checks fall under what stats.

| Basic Stat   | Adventuring Checks                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Power        | Pushing and Pulling, Jumping Far, Feats of Strength                |
| Defense      | Resisting Poison and Disease, Tanking\*, Resisting Push and Pull   |
| Speed        | Dexterity, Balance, Footwork, Handwork, Aim, Acrobatics, Sprinting |
| Intelligence | Perception\*\*, Hacking\*\*, Reasoning, Remembering, Charisma      |

- \*Tanking is when a character is braces themself so successfully that they are hit with an effect but don't take any damage from it. You cannot Tank in combat (that's what your Defense DC is for: determining when you do and don't take damage).
- \*\*Perception and Hacking have their own Secondary Stats, so they not only increase with Intelligence but can be incremented by gear Stat Buffs as well.

## Gaining XP

When you get to the end of a node you'll be rewarded XP equal to the difficulty of the node you just got through, with larger nodes giving you double their difficulty.

Your GM will make it so you have to do at least a portion of the node in order to get through it! But regardless, gear matters much more than levelling up in the long run so it's usually a good idea to scour it for drops.

## Fall Damage

There is no fall damage unless the node itself has a rule for fall damage!

## Using Energy Out of Combat

Active Abilities can be used out of combat whenever you want, and Passive Abilities can't be used out of combat (unless stated otherwise).

Swapping equipment out, sending gear to allies, and using Consumables does not take Energy if done out of combat.

## Hacking

When you hack, you spend an energy of any type roll your Hacking stat each round against a decaying DR (once per turn). Each round that your hacking there's a chance that something will happen, such as a defense response, the hacker taking damage, or, at the most extreme, a anti-hacking virus trying to find out your location in the physical world. You won't know the possible responses until you begin hacking.

Also, too many failures and whatever you're trying to hack will lock down, possibly sending reinforcements, dealing damage to the would-be hacker, or dealing out some other gnarly consequence.

> [!example]
> You begin hacking a cache of money. The decaying DR is 40, looks like this'll be a toughie. 
> 
> You roll a 15 to start, nice, the DR goes down to 25. The GM rolls on a table, oh looks like they found you! Your team has to fight off a couple of firewall defense programs.
> 
> You roll a 5, damn. The DR goes down to 20, the GM rolls again. Surprise! They employ counter-hacking viruses that your team has to beat, and is now more overwhelmed than ever.
> 
> You roll again, a 14, so close! DR is down to 6, but the GM rolls and says they're now trying to figure out where your physical bodies are. Better hurry!
> 
> You roll one more time, and you get a 7! Nice, you're in. You grab all the cash, and just in time, too; if you had failed they would've found out your real-life location. You destroy the defense programs and viruses, collect their loot, and are on your way.

# Nodes

Nodes are shaped by whoever created them or maintains them, and often have environments similar to that of real life places. Nodes are created for all sorts of purposes: to protect something precious, as procedurally generated worlds to explore, or even as somebody's passion project. 

Nodes can be created as or collected into Node Groups, where all are of the same or similar biome or inhabited by a consistent community of people. These nodes will often have consistent themes and scenery, and you and your party may be recruited to help out whoever lives there in order to pass through.

Others nodes are massive, containing strange worlds sometimes as big as a planet, consisting only of sprawling labyrinths or webs of dungeons, endless fields of mountains or seas endlessly deep. Each node is a surprise, and each should pose a unique challenge!

## Node Inhabitants

Some nodes have been completely abandoned; these often still have caches of credits, knowledge, or items in them, and are sometimes still protected, sometimes not. Other nodes have people, AIs, or other entities living within them, and you may have to interact with or fight these beings in order to pass through.

Occasionally you might find mortals who either had their consciousnesses uploaded into the web somehow or people who are stuck in the web, unable to return to their physical body. These people might have a home node that they respawn when they die, or they might be Untethered, where dying puts them in a random node on the web.

AIs that you find on the web might be hostile, insane, cordial, or completely pliant; they might have full agency or might be defined and bound by their directives. Regardless, AIs don't have physical bodies to return to, and if they are killed they might respawn in some capacity or be dead for good (depending on what safeguards were put into place when they were made).

## Node Rules and Other Specifics

Often the entrance and exit of a node will be on the edges of the node geography, so you have to traverse the node to get to the exit, but others have more illogical entrances and exits! Some nodes will have their exits guarded or secreted away, and others might have hidden alternate exits that lead to shortcut or detour nodes.

Certain nodes will have specific rules that apply only to them. For example, some nodes might have fall damage if their terrain is especially vertical, or others might include drowning mechanics. 

Specific node rules all depend on what the GM decides to build into the node! If you're a GM this is your chance to experiment with interesting mechanics (but try not to overcomplicate things too much).

# Traversing the Web

Often to get to the node you want you'll have to travel through other nodes which can be full of viruses, AIs, firewall defenses, traps, puzzles, and other threats and obstacles.

## Choosing a Route

When traversing the web you'll usually be presented with several different node routes you can take, each with their own particular risks and possible rewards.

Each node on a possible route will have certain characteristics:
- Danger Level: nodes are ranked in danger from I to X
	- You gain XP equal to the Node Danger Level every time you clear a node (meaning you overcome the main obstacle of the node)
- Node Contents: each node will reveal what type of vibe each node has
	- Puzzle
	- Trap
	- Combat
	- ???
- Loot Type: nodes might have special loot within, either hidden, guarded, or locked behind a puzzle or trap
	- Credits
	- Gear Drop
	- Mod Box
	- Essence Gem
	- Lore Codex
	- Hidden Loot

There should be enough loot dropped for everybody in the party, whether it be credits, gear, mods, or essence.

Here's what a node route might look like:

![[Pasted image 20250708220520.png]]

GMs: Feel free to get creative with your node routes: make routes of different lengths and danger levels, ones that change as you move through them, or ones where you only see a couple choices at a time!

## Secure Sectors

Some node webs will have different levels of security which affect how easy it is to warp in and out of them.

- **No Security**: you can warp in and out of the node whenever you want
- **Low Security**: you can warp out of the node if it's clear of danger but you can't warp into the node
- **High Security**: you can't warp in or out of the node no matter what, and if you die your cyberghost gets locked there or sent to somewhere random

## Returning to Your Home Node

At any time after clearing a node of danger your party may return right back to your home node, even if you're in a secure or locked system! You'll have to return to the entrance to the node to leave if you haven't cleared the node.

Just remember that if you are in a secure or locked system and you decide to leave you'll have to go through a node route again if you return, which will have repopulated its threats or even changed entirely.

## Recording Node Addresses

When you get where you're wanting to go or just want to return to a location later you can record the address of the node and return to it whenever you'd like! Unless you've entered a secure system, in which case you can record the address of a node just outside the system but can't record locations inside the system.

## Opportunities on the Web

- Meet randos, AIs
- Find old troves of knowledge, or caches hidden away by governments, corporations, or mobs
- Find stashes of money! Many people hide credits on the web

# Some GM Tips

## Dealing With Gear Drops

Given the random nature of Gear Generation, your players might end up "unbalanced": they might end up with way more HP than they deal damage, or vice versa.

One person might end up with a game-breaking piece of gear, such as a rare Kernel that gives them a powerful ability or a weapon that deals an absurd amount of damage.

How do you deal with situations like this?

First of all, try to scale the HP and damage of the enemies your players are fighting separately based on how much damage they deal and how much HP they have themselves. 

For example, if your party has way more HP than they deal damage, try to have them face enemies that deal more damage but don't have quite as much HP so that battles feel more balanced.

Another thing you can do is just choose what kind of gear you want to give your party to fill in any stat or damage gaps.

## Make It Feel Rewarding

Another tip is to give your players chances to use their Actives and Passives! Challenge your players, but don't give them a piece of gear that they never get a chance to use.

The game should feel rewarding, which means both making them work for their successes *and also* giving them opportunities to do things that make them feel cool.

Don't worry **too** much about everything being balanced: so much is randomized that it can't be 100% balanced no matter how hard you try. Just have fun and help your players have fun!

## Be Light on Your Toes

Don't get too attached to any path or conclusion! Your players will challenge you, push you into places you weren't prepared for, and do things you don't expect. 

Ride with them! Adapt your plans to what they do. Add more enemies if they're beating a combat encounter too quickly. Give them a way to escape if they're getting thrashed.
