# General Rules

The mechs you'll be building are the Valdan variety, 100-150 tons, 3-6 stories tall (~40-80 ft), and extremely modular. They're built for adaptability and work just as well in space as they do on the ground.

## Stats

Mechs have four main stats. Attacks are rolled against a Stat Defense DC usually chosen by the defender.

Here are the Main Stats that you'll use to make checks:

| Main Stat  | Description                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agility    | How quick and dexterous your mech is.                    |
| Strength   | How strong your mech is.                                 |
| Durability | How tough your mech is, for defend and resistance rolls. |
| Aim        | How good your mech is at aiming.                         |

And here are the Secondary Stats:

## Part Types

Your mech stats are determined by what parts make up your mech.

There are eleven mech part types:

| Part Type | Stats Affected               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Some parts come with special abilities that also use energy.

Check the [[Icy Speck Mech Parts]], [[Kollopsis Mech Parts]], and [[Redmark Mech Parts]] for parts to build mechs with!

## Pilot Level

As you grow as a pilot you get better at piloting your mech! You get new Specializations as you level up as a pilot, which happens as you go on missions, gain experience, and pilot your mech.

You have as many Pilot Specializations as equal to your Pilot Level! Pilot Level has a max of 5, and every time you level up you may trade one Specialization in for another.

**Very important:** You may only use one attack-amplifying ability per attack! (Applies only to abilities from Pilot Specializations and Mech Upgrades.)

| Pilot <br>Level | Pilot<br>Spec. | Max<br>Upgrades | Max<br>Modules |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| 1               | 1              | 2               | 1              |
| 2               | 2              | 3               | 1              |

| Safe Pilot         | When your mech is reduced to 0 HP you only have a 1 in 50 chance of the ejection failing (roll 1d100 and on a 1 or a 2 the ejection fails). |

> [!NOTE] Stat Percent Stacking
> Stat increases expressed in a percent **stack** with other stat increases expressed in a percent. For example, a mech with both the Agility Up Spec. and the Ailith Eagle Lightening Module increases their Load Limit and Agility by **50% total**, not 25% and then another 25% calculated from the new total.

## Mech Upgrades

You can work on your mech yourself and give your mech upgrades!

Your upgrades must be installed at a mech shop or some other place with a mech engineering setup (including your own mech bay if you have one). This process takes at least a couple hours of downtime to install.

These Upgrades only spend energy when explicitly stated. You may combine any of these abilities on the same attack or Defense DC if you wish, but you can't use one ability more than once in a turn!

# Gameplay

In your mech you'll roll d100, where the higher you roll the closer you get to 100% efficiency. Most mechs have 100 or more health.

## Combat Basics

Initiative is decided by each individual person rolling an Agility roll and whoever gets highest goes first, then next etc. etc.

Out of combat you always have Energy equal to your Energy Gain stored up, so when you enter combat this is how much you'll start with.

All combat is attack rolls vs a Defense DC.

| Stat       | Attack              | Defend                                       | Other Info                              |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Agility    | Quick melee weapons | Dodging                                      |                                         |
| Strength   | Heavy melee weapons | Blocking, deflecting with a shield or weapon |                                         |
| Durability | -                   | Tanking                                      | Also used for resisting certain effects |
| Aim        | All ranged attacks  | -                                            |                                         |

Some more considerations:
- Melee Range is 50 ft.
- Flying: You can use your thrusters to fly on your turn, but you must end your turn on the ground (unless you're in space or your parts say otherwise).
- Opportunity Attack: Yes! When any enemy exits your melee range you may roll to hit them. Enemies can do this to you as well!

## Defense

When defending against an attack you may decide to use any stat to defend, and then your enemy will roll against your Defense DC to see whether they hit you or not. To calculate your Defense DC use this formula: 

> [!Formula] 
> 50 + Stat + Extra Defense Bonuses (if any) = Defense DC

For example, I'm using Strength to defend, so my Defense DC is 50 + 35 (Str) = 85 because I don't have any extra defense bonuses. My opponent rolls a 93 to hit, so they hit me!

Remember that **meets beats**: attacker always wins ties.

> [!Warning] Note
> Certain attacks will force you to use the Defense DC of a certain stat!

### Armor HP

Armor is a little bank of HP on top of your core HP, and some armor only blocks certain types of damage:
- Xenic armor only blocks xenic attacks (like heat and cold beams) and is only depleted by xenic attacks, but is resistance against xenic attacks.
- Onyx armor only blocks physical attacks and is only depleted by physical attacks, but is resistant against physical. Onyx armor completely blocks obsidian attacks.
- Standard armor blocks and is depleted by all types of attacks.

A mech can only ever have one set of armor on at one time unless otherwise stated! And armor regenerates fully after an hour since it was last damaged.

### Status Effects

To inflict a status effect, you first need a weapon or part that will inflict that status effect. You'll roll to hit, and if you hit you deal damage, then the defender compares their Dura Defense DC against your attack roll to determine if they resist the status effect. Then if they fail that one they also take the status effect.

- Frozen: the next attack does double damage

## Distance and Cover

### Moving and Dashing

Default move speed with thrusters per turn is 300 ft, you may take this on your turn without spending energy. You may also spend a energy to move your speed per turn again.

If for any reason you ever don't have thrusters your move speed is 100 ft per turn.

### Range

Each gun has a Range Rating that determines how to calculate their effective range. Standard Range is 300 ft.

Shooting an enemy that's out of your effective range is done with disadvantage.

Some guns have combination ranges, such as Close-Medium, or Medium-Far. These ranges take the **closest** Minimum Range and the **farthest** Maximum range (e.g. Close-Medium has a Min Range of 50 ft and a Max Range of your Range stat).

| Range Rating | Min Range | Max Range |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Close        | 50 ft     | Range / 2 |
| Medium       | 150 ft    | Range     |
| Far          | 300 ft    | Range x 2 |
| Unlimited    | 30 ft     | None      |

Drones typically just use the Medium Range Rating for how far they can shoot, though some drones might be different. Drones can travel distance equal to your Range away from your mech, and can be as close to you as you'd like.

### Cover

Being behind cover reduces the damage you take! The amount of coverage you have is what percent of your body is shielded or not visible by an enemy.

Full cover means you take 0 dmg (100% coverage), 75% coverage means you take 75% damage, half coverage means you take 50% damage, and quarter coverage means you take 25% damage. 

If you'd like you can use stranger percentages (such as 98.454% coverage), but the weirder it gets the harder it is to calculate!

## Energy

You can use as much Energy a turn as you wish. You have half your Energy Cap stored up outside of combat, and then your energy capacity opens up to your full max as you enter "combat mode". 

You gain Energy at the end of your turn.

### Pushing Past Your Energy Limits

When spending Energy you can choose to go past your Energy Cap (effectively spending Energy you don't have) and as a result incur a level of Spirit Decay. You take one level of Spirit Decay per action that spends energy beyond your Energy Cap, and the effects of that Spirit Decay apply after your action is over. You can never spend over your Energy Cap's worth of energy on one action.

Check the [[Spirit Decay]] page for info on the effects of Spirit Decay.


> [!example]
> You have 0 Energy and your Energy Cap is 10, but it's down to the wire and you really need to do some extra damage. You decide to push past your limits and do an attack with 10 Energy. You'll get one level of Spirit Decay and roll on a Spirit Decay Table to decide what negative effects you'll get. These negative effects apply after you complete your action.

## Weapon Details

### Charging Weapons

Weapons need to be in-hand to charge up.

### Switching Weapons

It's free to switch a weapon or shield at the start or end of a turn (but you can't switch at the start and end in one turn).

It takes an energy to switch weapons during your turn or to switch weapons when you've already switched once.

Ex. 1: You switch at the start of your turn, and it costs an energy to switch at the end of your turn.
Ex. 2: You decide to switch during your turn, and you didn't switch at the start. It costs an energy to switch.

### Drones

Are pretty small and as such can't be hit directly! To take a drone down, take down the operator.

Drones use your Aim stat to hit.

## Damage

### Repairing Damage

| Repair Threshold | Repair Cost      |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 100%-75% HP      | Highest Stat x 1 |
| 75%-50% HP       | Highest Stat x 2 |
| 50%-25% HP       | Highest Stat x 3 |
| 25%-1% HP        | Highest Stat x 4 |
| Totalled         | Highest Stat x 5 |

### Getting Totaled

If your mech reaches 0 HP you will need to spend as many credits as your mech's highest stat x 3 to repair it, and there's a chance a part has been completely destroyed, in which case you will need to replace it.

The pod has 50 HP and 50 Agi to dodge. You get 100 ft of movement that you can use immediately after your mech gets totaled.

When your mech reaches 0 HP you roll a d10. 
- On a 2-10 you eject and are in a pod with limited mobility. 
- On a 1 the ejection fails and you take 2d12 dmg and, if you fall unconscious with that damage, you roll another d10:
	- 6-10: You're knocked out and are inflicted with the [[Critical Injuries#Blunt Trauma|Blunt Trauma Critical Injury]], start doing death saves!
	- 2-5: You're knocked out and are inflicted with the [[Critical Injuries#Bleeding Out|Bleeding Out Critical Injury]], start doing death saves!
	- 1: MAIMED
		- You're inflicted with the [[Critical Injuries#Maimed|Maimed Critical Injury]]! You might lose a limb or something.
