- [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Chroma|Chroma]] and [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Stats|Stats]]
	- Choose a chroma: Red, Blue, Green, or Grey. Each one has a corresponding stat.
		- Red: Vigor
		- Blue: Endurance
		- Green: Initiative
		- Grey: Wit
	- Take one of the following:
		- +2 to your chroma stat and a +1 to a different stat
		- +3 to your chroma stat, a +1 to a different stat, and a -1 to another stat
		- +2 to two different stats and a -1 to another stat (for people with multiple chromas)
	- You can also take a clear chroma if you'd like, but that means you can't take the adept class.
		- For clear chroma, take a +1 to to three different stats, +2 to your Powerful Item Limit, and 2 extra skills.
	- As you [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Leveling Up]] you upgrade your stats.
- Species
	- Check out the [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Species|Species]] and pick one of them!
	- Each species has visual characteristics and a common chroma that you may take if you like.
- [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Classes|Classes]]
	- Pick a class! Classes grant magical abilities, technological skills, or superpowers.
		- [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#_Adepts|Adepts]] have superpowers that are tied to their chroma.
		- [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Mages|Mages]] make pacts with gods, demons and devils that grant them support abilities, healing powers, and damage.
		- [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Magicians|Magicians]] learn the a magical language that control the xeon and grant them flexible power and utility.
		- [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#_Technologists|Technologists]] can create gadgets and weapons that give them all sorts of skills and abilities.
	- Click [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Class Reference Chart|here]] for a class reference chart with more details.
- [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Health and Injuries|Health and Injuries]]
	- Start with 10 + Vig + 2x End HP for Level 0.
	- When you fail on Action Rolls you'll take an injury which will affect future Action Rolls
- [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Stamina and Mastery Die|Mastery Die]]
	- At Level 1 you have a d4 Mastery Die, which gets better as you [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Leveling Up|level up]].
	- You can add this die to checks you do using class abilities, and you have to spend a stamina every time you use your class abilities.
- Skills
	- At Level 1 you start with 2 skills which may be General or Specific.
		- General Skills get a +2
			- Some examples of General Skills are stealth, insight, persuasion, and investigation.
		- Specific Skills get a +3
			- Some examples of Specific Skills are slinging, intimidation, nature, history, cooking, and plumbing.
	- Look at the [[Skill List]] for ideas, but you can pick anything you want! 
		- A good rule of thumb is if it seems like a skill would affect a wide range of checks or would be commonly used in a normal campaign then it's probably a General Skill. Stealth only gets a +2 because it's a pretty common skill check to use.
	- Check [[XRRPG 2.0 Core Rules#Leveling Up|Leveling Up]] for at which levels you upgrade skills and get new skills.
